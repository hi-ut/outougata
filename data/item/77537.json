        "Originally a term designating provincial governor during the Heian era, this institution was revived by Go-Daigo, who tended to appoint both shugo and kokushi to provinces during his short lived Kenmu Regime (1333-1336). A few, such as the Kitabatake in Ise Province, managed to retain local power for well over a century after the outbreak of civil war, but most became supplanted by shugo, particularly after the establishment of hanzei privileges.
