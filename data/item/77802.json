        "In 1352, the Muromachi Bakufu instituted a practice known as hanzei, in which half the income from estate lands was to go to warriors. Ostensibly a temporary measure to tide over the shogunate's supporters as they continued their struggle against the forces supporting the rival southern court, this tax became permanent, and was interpreted broadly to mean that warriors took over half the actual land of estates."
