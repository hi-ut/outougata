        "The Mizushidokoro (Palace Kitchen Office) performed similar functions [to the Imperial Table Office/Naizenshi], participating in the presentation of Imperial repasts and also serving food and wine at Court banquets. Its principal officer, a Superintendent, sometimes also headed the Palace Storehouse Bureau of the Central Affairs Ministry. Lower Mizushidokoro posts, hereditary in minor families, included comorant handlers and others involved in the procurement of fish and game (p812). [内膳司]"
