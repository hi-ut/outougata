        "愛染（明）王, also referred to as Zen'ai-ō (染愛王).  This deity, Rāga, is the patron of love, and was thus approached by esoteric Buddhists in Japan primarily for the acquisition of another's affection or safe childbirth from the 11th century on.  At the same time, he could also be approached for the purpose of overcoming one's enemies.  He was also thought to possess a wish-fulfilling jewel in one of his hands, and was sometimes approached through veneration of the jewel in the form produced in esoteric Buddhism, a rite usually called nyohō aizen hō (如法愛染法)."
