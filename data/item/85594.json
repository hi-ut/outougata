        "(One of the two types of recluse poetry). The pioneer of this genre is traditionally though to be Xie Lingyun.  The poet is a hermit, and his cell is hidden in the depths of nature.  The setting of the poem is uncultivated, not a pastoral scenery but real wilderness, its atmosphere is mystical rather than political.
