        "“public managed fields”—public fields, the cultivation of which was to be performed by cultivators fulfilling their labor tax (yôeki 庸役) obligation under the supervision of local managers. The model for the system was proposed by Ono Minemori (778-830), chief administrator at the Dazaifu, in 823."
