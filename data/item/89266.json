        "As prescribed by the Yōrō Code, the Board of Censors was a group of some forty officials, headed by a President (In) of Junior Third Rank, whose function was to scrutinize the conduct of every member of the bureaucracy, from the Minister of the Left down, on behalf of the Emperor.  An importation from China based on Confucian political theory, the board met with a cool welcome in Japan, and its functions quickly atrophied or were transferred elsewhere.  Nevertheless, its presidency remained a prestigious (if nominal) office, reserved ordinarily for an Imperial Prince (p. 812). [養老令、尹（いん）] [HW]"
