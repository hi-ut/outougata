        "（alt., Chūsenshi) In 708 the first such office was created as an extracodal agency, and miniting of coins began with the Wadō kaichin 和同開珎, or Wadō coins. Initially both silver and copper coins were minted, but later only copper coins were produced. There were branches of the agency, charged with both mining and minting, in the provinces of Kawachi, Suō, Nagato, and Yamashiro. [河内、周防、長門、山城]"
