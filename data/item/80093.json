        "The 5 great vows uttered by Dainichi, and which should also be the aspiration of every Shingon practitioner (as opposed to the 4 vows uttered in exoteric Mahāyāna): to save all sentient beings without limit, to accumulate benefits and wisdom without limit, to understand the Buddha dharma without limit, to become a Thus-Come One, and to realize the highest level of bodhi."
