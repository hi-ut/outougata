        "Fujiwara no Motofusa (J.) 藤原基房, also called 松殿, 菩提院 Matsudono, Bodai'in. This son of the regent and chancellor 忠通 Tadamichi (1097-1164) became minister of the right and then the left as well as leader of the northern Fujiwara clan at a young age. Eventually coming to be on bad terms with the Taira military leaders, he became close to retired emperor Go-Shirakawa, and in the early 1170s--still in his 20s--became minister and then chancellor. However, despised by the powerful Taira no Kiyomori (1118-81) particularly over his selection of his young son Moro'ie (1172-1238) as deputy middle counsellor, Motofusa chose to became a monk in 1179 rather than be exiled to Dazaifu, Kyushu. Motofusa briefly regained political influence through managing to orchestrate Moro'ie's rise to regent in 1183, but when Moro'ie was forced to quit the next year, Motofusa left public life completely, and was known until his death in 1230 as an expert on court rules and ritual protocol."
