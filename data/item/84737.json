        "a temple built by royal command, supported by official resources, and serving as a stage for official Buddhist rituals to protect the realm. Historians generally consider the first daiji to have been Kudaradaiji (later known as Takechidaiji and then as Daianji) initiated by Great King Jomei in the mid-seventh century. Temmu's Kiyomihara capital included three daiji. By the eighth century, daiji were often presided over by royally appointed prelates. Seven temples were eventually designated as official temples where realm-protecting rites were to be held. [百済大寺、高市大寺、大安寺、舒明、天武、浄御原宮]"
