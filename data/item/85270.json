        "Attributed to the legendary Shōtoku Taishi (574-622), [the Miraiki] prophesised (among other things, and depending on which of the extant editions were consulted) that the reign of the ninety-fifth emperor would be truly epochal, witnessing a forced abdication followed some seven hundred days later by a return to the emperorship; the eastern barbarians would be replaced by the emperor, the eastern fish gobbled up by the western bird (p. 102). [聖徳太子] [HW]"
