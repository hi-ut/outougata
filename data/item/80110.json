        "A set of records of the Latter Seven-Day Rite compiled between the 12th and 13th c. by monks of Hoju'in at Ninnaji. Although compiled by monks of the Hirosawa branch, the work contains some records which was (allegedly) signed by 明算 Meizan (1021-1106), founder of the 中院流 Chūinryū lineage of the Ono branch at Mount Kōya."
