        "Thick, lined surplices with patches of various colors and shapes, worn especially by high-ranking monks.  Although all kesa were supposed to be improvised from cast-off rags, and thus to symbolize the renunciation of worldly desires, the nō no kesa were made of gold cloth, brocade, and other expensive fabrics (p. 557 n.)."
