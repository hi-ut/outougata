        "A compilation of five records of the offerings made to Tōdaiji by Empress Kōmyō between 756-758. The records are: 1. Kokka chinpō chō (Record of the Nation's Rare Treasures), dated the twenty-first day of the sixth month of 756 2. Shuju yaku chō (Record of Various Medicines), dated the twenty-first day of the sixth month of 756 3. Byōbu kasen tō chō (Record of Folding Screens, Patterned Rugs, Etc.), dated the twenty-sixth day of the seventh month of 756 4. Daishō-ō shinseki chō (Record of Calligraphic Writings of Wang Xizhi and his son Wang Xianzhi), dated the first day of the sixth month of 758 5. Fujiwara-kō shinseki byōbu chō (Record of Folding Screens with Lord Fujiwara no Fuhito's Calligraphic Writings), dated the first day of the tenth month of 758 Extant Shōsō-in treasures listed in these records are especially valuable on account of their clear historical origins. Of the seven-hundred objects listed in the Tōdaiji kenmotsu chō, over one hundred are thought to still be stored in the Shōsō-in today. [光明皇后、国家珍宝帳、種々薬帳、屏風花氈等帳、大小王真跡帳、藤原公真跡屏風帳、藤原不比等、正倉院、東大寺]"
