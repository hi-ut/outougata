        "Warps are displaced over one another in a complicated arrangement of crossings that create patterns such as diagonal lattices and lozenges. The crossed warps are held in place by the wefts. These crossings can have two basic constructions, net (ami mojiri) or basket (kagome mojiri) . Complex ra gauzes can be differentiated from sha, simple gauzes, which appear infrequently among the Shōsō-in treasures. [網綟、籠綟、紗、正倉院]"
