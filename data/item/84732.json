        "the royal residence, or a part thereof, at Temmu's Kiyomihara palace. An entry in the Shoku nihongi suggests that such a building existed at the Nara palace as well, and that banquets for high ranking ministers were held there. Some scholars regard the Daianden as an alternative appelation for the Daigokuden. [天武、浄御原宮、続日本紀、太極殿]"
