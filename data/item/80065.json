        "Fujiwara no Tadachika (J.) 藤原忠親, also known as 中山忠親 Nakayama Tadachika. This aristocrat held positions such as chamberlain and head of chamberlains before rising to the position of deputy major counsellor in 1183 and minister of the center in 1191. Author of works such as the voluminous diary Sankaiki and perhaps the historical tale Mizu kagami, Tadachika was close to both the leading Tairas and the retired emperor Go-Shirakawa, and died in 1195 at age 63."
