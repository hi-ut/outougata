        "a “houseman” or client. The term appears in the ritsuryô codes as one category of dependent persons whose status was higher than that of slaves (nuhi 奴婢). And while such status could be transmitted through generations, ke’nin could not be sold. By Heian times, the term was used to denote the clients of noble households. [律令] [家人]"
