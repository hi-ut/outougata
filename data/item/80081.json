        "Chien-chen (Ch.) 鑑真, posthumous name Kakai daishi (過海大師). Chinese master of the precepts who met visiting Japanese monks in 742, and who later arrived in Japan in 754. Upon arriving in the capital of Nara, he was ordered to take residence in Tōdaiji, where he established a precepts platform (戒壇 kaidan) and conferred the bodhisattva precepts on an assembly of more than 400 believers. Later, he was given land upon which he oversaw the construction of the temple Tōshōdaiji (唐招提寺)."
