        "(alt., Sōgōsho) Ｔhe Prelates' Office, reportedly instituted by Great King Suiko in the early seventh century. Its members were the highest-ranking Buddhist monastics in the realm, and they served as leading ritualists and teachers. Prelates of the 　　Sōgō were appointed and promoted by command of the Great King and later, the tennō. Promotion of such prelates was more or less regular after an initial appointment to risshi rank; only rarely was a monk promoted to a rank above risshi without having first served in that most junior position. Appointments to the Sōgō over time can be traced through the Sōgō bunin 僧綱補任, or Register of Sōgō Appointments, compiled in the late Heian period. [推古、天皇]"
