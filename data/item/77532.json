        "Kenmu Regime. A fleeting regime (1333-1336) created by the emperor Go-Daigo after he destroyed the Kamakura bakufu. An uprising led by Ashikaga Takauji led to the demise of the Kenmu Regime early in 1336, and marked the onset of the Nanbokuchō era and sixty years of indeterminate civil war. [後醍醐、足利尊氏、建武、南北朝]"
