        "(1193-1251) The grandson of Kujo Kanezane (1149-1207), Michiie was raised to restore the glory of the Kujo lineage within the dominating regent's branch of the Fujiwara. He became Minister of the Left (sadaijin) in 1218 and regent for Emperor Chukyo in 1221. Although Michiie maintained a middle stance in the Jokyu War of 1221, he was forced to resign as regent. However, he was able to resume the regency in 1228, two years after his fourth son, Kujo Yoritsune, had become shogun in Kamakura, much highly active in court politics, attempting to dominate both Kyoto and Kamakura, until Yoritsune's failed uprising against shogunal regent Hojo Tokiyori in 1246."
