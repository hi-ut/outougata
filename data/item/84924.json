        "The four heavenly kings\" associated with the four directions who protect the Buddha. They are portrayed iconographically as fearsome armored generals. In various Buddhist sutras popular in sixth- and seventh-century Japan, they were also said to protect members of the Buddhist community. Thus they became objects of official rituals and petitions. Early images appeared at Shiten'ōji and Hōryūji, established in the seventh century. At eighth-century Shin-Yakushiji and Tōdaiji, they protected the four corners of the Buddha's altar.
