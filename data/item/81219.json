        "Game played with a small deerskin bal on a hard-surfaced square court, approximately seven meters long on each side.  Eight men, of whom two were stationed under each of four trees at the court's corners, attempted to keep the ball in the air for as many counts as possible, using only their feet.  Counting, which began after the fiftieth kick, continued in theory to 1,000, the perfect score, but the usual score seems to have been below 300 (p.404)."
