        "Historical period that spanned nearly four hundred years, from about 794, when Emperor Kammu established Heiankyō (now Kyoto) as the imperial capital, to 1185, when the Minamoto forces defeated those of the Taira, thus setting the stage for the establishment of the Kamakura bakufu. Emperor Kammu ascended to the throne in 781, and in 784, the capital then located in Heijōkyō (in Nara) was moved to Nagaokakyō. Some classifications prefer either of these two dates as the beginning of the period. In addition, some end it in 1180, when Minamoto Yoritomo established his headquarters in Kamakura. It is noted as a period of great cultural development centered on the imperial court.　[桓武天皇、平安京、源、平、鎌倉幕府、平城京、長岡京]"
