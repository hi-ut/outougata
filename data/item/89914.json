        "A type of silk gauze woven in a plain-gauze binding system in which alternate ends (the doup ends) were regularly crossed to the left or right over adjacent ends (the fixed ends), and then recrossed to their originial positions after being bound by picks.  This binding system produced gauze crosses linked by ends vertically, instead of diagonally, as in an alternating-gauze weave (ra).  (p. 419) [羅]"
