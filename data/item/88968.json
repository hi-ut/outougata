        "A courtier diary written by Saionji Kinhira (1264-1315), which covers a thirty-two-year-long period from 1283 to 1315, much of which still remains. It is also included in the Saionji family's source collection known as the Kankenki. The Kinhira koki is very useful for its coverage of the imperial court and its relationship with the bakufu in the late Kamakura era."
