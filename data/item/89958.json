        "The Household of an Imperial Prince is known to have had a senior officer, the Imperial Superintendent (Chokubettō), who held the Daijōkan office of Counselor.  There was also a Chamberlains' Office (Kurōdodokoro), corresponding to the Chamberlains' Office at the Imperial Palace, with three Superintendents who were usually second-level Bodyguards officers, Imperial Chamberlains, or comparable officials; an Attendants' Office (Saburaidokoro); and an Administrative Office (Mandokoro), staffed by several Superintendents (Head Chamberlain, Controllers, and so forth--also called Keishi) and by lesser officials with some of the same titles used in the In no Chō (p. 825).
