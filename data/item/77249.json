        "A decorative lacquer technique for in which smooth pieces of mother-of-pearl from turban or other shells are affixed to a lacquered surface and covered with another layer of lacquer. Lacquer is then removed from the shell surfaces. Another method of inlaying shell is to carve out shallow beds into a wooden surface in which to embed the shells directly. Inlaid shell pieces are often incised with delicate hairline engraving."
