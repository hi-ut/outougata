        "The standard unit of measuring length in the Nara period was the Tempyō shaku (29.6cm) , which was based on the Tang-dynasty equivalent, the chi (also 29.6cm) . A shaku is made up of 10 sun, and 1 sun comprises 10 bu. The kane shaku used today in Japan is longer than its predecessor at 30.3 cm. [寸、分、曲尺]"
