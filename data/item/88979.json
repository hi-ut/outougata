        "A diary written by Nakahara Moromori (years unknown), who served as a scribe, as did many others of his family line, for the imperial court in Kyoto. This is an extensive work, written between 1339 and 1374, dealing mostly with court procedures, but it also reflects the sentiments and struggles during the era of the two courts."
