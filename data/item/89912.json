        "Youth of the Snowy Mountains was a name used of Śākyamuni when he was a bodhisattva in a previous existence.  (Snowy Mountains is a name for the Himalayas.) During that time, Indra disguised himself as a demon and tested ↓Śākyamuni by reciting the first half of the hymn mentioned in the text.  Only after Śākyamuni had offered his body as food to the demon was he permitted to hear the second half. (p. 768)"
