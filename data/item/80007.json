        "Chōgen (重源), also called Shunjōbō (俊乗房), Namu Amida Butsu (南無阿弥陀佛). Monk known especially for his efforts as a fundraising monk to acquire materials for the reconstruction of the temple in the 1180s and 90s. Trained in Shingon, he was especially attracted to the practice of nenbutsu recitation within the tradition, and later became a disciple of Hōnen, founder of the Jōdo school. His activitieis as a fundraiser and his relative independence from the institutions of the era were reasons he was called a holy man (hijiri), though he had very close ties to powerful figures such as Go-Shirakawa."
