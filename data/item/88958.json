        "A war tale that chronicles the rise and fall of the Taira in the twelfth century. Extant versions of the chronicle date to the Tokugawa age, but the work was probably produced first in the thirteenth century. Though some descriptions are undoubtedly exaggerated, many entries can be verified in other, more contemporary sources."
