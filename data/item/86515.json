        "Markets were a junction of two realms, the secular and the sacred, a point of temporal and spatial connection. The term ichi, which stands for both priestesses\" and \"markets,\" metonymically joined the two worlds and symbolically assured the continuum between the two.  Priestesses regularly intoned prayers at ceremonies held at markets, giving a concrete expression to the hope for the perpetuation of this coninuum (p. 114). \""
