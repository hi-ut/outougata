        "[Also azuma-mai (東舞, Eastern dancing\")] [Sacred music and dancing presented at festivals.] An azuma-asobi program usually required the services of one or more singers, four or six dancers, and a small orchestra consisting of a Japanese zither (wagon, a six-stringed koto), a flute (komabue), and oboe (hichiriki), and pair of clappers (shakubyōshi).  The performers were usually members of the [Court] Bodyguards who came from musical families.  A full program consisted of five sections:  two introductory songs (icni no uta, ni no uta); a first dance, \"Suruga-mai,\" accompanied by songs with a strong folk flavor; a shorter second dance, \"Motomeko,\" with more formal lyrics; and closing music (kataoroshi), during which the dancers retired (p. 404).
