        "Enryakuji (J.) 延暦寺, also known as 比叡山寺, 一乗止観院, 比江寺, 山門, 山, 台嶺, 北嶺, 叡岳 Hieizanji, Ichijō shikan'in, Hiedera*, Sanmon, Yama, Tairei, Hokurei, Eigaku. Main monastery of the Tendai school. Saichō first established a hut for religious practice on Mount Hiei in 785, and in 787, having constructed a healing Buddha image, he called the temple Hieizanji and, then, Ichijō shikan'in. After his study in China (804-805), Saichō established a monastery there to train monks of the Tendai school, winning the paronage of the government through the argument that it would be a place of practice for protection of the nation, and that the monks trained there would be treasures of the realm. In 823, the temple was renamed Enryakuji by imperial decree; after 858, when Encin and his followers ended a dispute by exiting Enryakuji for Onjōji, the temple came commonly to be called Sanmon, to distinguish it from the latter, which was referred to as 寺門 Jimon. Enryakuji grew to have more than 3,000 buildings, and by the 12th c. employed large numbers of resident workers who would act militarily on behalf of the interests of the leading clerics at Hiei when commanded. The presence of monks of, particularly, northern Fujiwara, together with military power enabled Enryakuji to acquire further alliances with aristocratic and military families, making it one f the most powerful temple complexes in medieval Japan. The power of Enryakuji was only subjugated through its destruction by Oda Nobunaga in 1571."
