        "An outer garment originally worn for hunting and then adopted by the nobles as everyday informal wear.  The hunting cloak had cords laced through the sleeves to allow them to be gathered at the wrist, and it had sleeves semi-detached from the body of the garment, for ease of movement.  It was worn with gathered trousers (sashinuki) or hunting trousers (karibakama) and a hat (eboshi). A gentleman normally wore a hunting cloak while travelling, and his attendants would wear it even when he was in court dress (nôshi sugata).  He also might wear it as a disguise.[指貫、狩袴、烏帽子、直衣姿][RK]"
