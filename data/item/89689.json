        "[An] official New Year event... [p381]. The second week of the First Month was devoted primarily to precautionary Buddhist observances, both exoteric and esoteric. The exoteric rites, performed as prayers for peaceful conditions and bountiful crops, consisted of an impressive series of daily lectures on the Golden Light Sutra (Konkōmyōkyō; Skt. Suvarnaprabhāsa-sūtra), delivered at the Daigokuden with the Emperor and Court in attendence. The misaie was one of the major Buddhist events in the regular Court calendar, equal in importance to the Ninnōe (p383n). [金光明経、大極殿、仁王会]"
