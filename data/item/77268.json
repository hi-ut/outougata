        "Colorless or milky quartz. Used in ancient Egypt and Rome as a material for ornaments or small vessels, it also used in ornaments unearthed in the Han dynasty tombs at Lelang (Naknang, North Korea). Rock crystal was used for arrowheads in Japan as early as the Jōmon period, and for small ornaments in the Kofun period. With the importation of Buddhist culture in the Asuka period, rock crystal was employed in a variety of objects, such as Buddhist prayer beads (J: juzu). [数珠]"
