        "Hokkai (J.) 法界, also written 達磨駄都 datsumadatsu or darumadatsu. This term (Sk. dharma-dhātu) refers to the dharma realm, that is, the essence of reality. It can also be used to refer to the entire universe. The term has very different meanings depending on the context and the school of Buddhism. In Shingon, for example, it refers to the 6 great elements of the universe (六大 rokudai--earth, water, fire, wind, space, consciousness) understood as essentially identical with the body of Dainichi). In Tendai, the term often refers to the 10 realms of birth--hell, hungry ghost, beast, titan, human, heaven, disciple of the Buddha, pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva, Buddha."
