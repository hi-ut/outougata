        "The official appointed by the Emperor to govern a province.  His rank, which depended on the standing of his province (the provinces were classified as great, major, medium, or minor) could vary from junior fifth rank, upper grade down to junior sixth rank, lower grade.  The term was sometimes used not only for a Governor proper but also for a Deputy Governor, in cases where only the Deputy actually went to the province.  Governors in general were also referred to as Zuryō (“Grant Holder”).[受領][RK]"
