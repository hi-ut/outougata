        "The appointment record for the Office of Monastic Affairs (sogo). Many versions remain, but the one from Kofukuji is the most extensive, beginning with appointments in 623 and ending in 1142, when the office had lost most of its leverage. It rarely contains any information beyond the appointment and the monk's name and religious lineage."
