        "artisans of the lathe called kijishi, or wood masters,\" produced the small, turned wooden objects destined for lacquerwork, as well as ordinary unlacquered bowls, ladles, and trays. (p.80)  This relatively simple spatial structure of production belies the complexies of capital relations in the industry, however, for lacquer suppliers were not the only financiers involved. Competing with them for control of the lucrative trade were representatives of its two main groups of skilled workers: master lathe-turners (wan'ya), who doubled as foremen and financiers for the kijishi, and lacquerware merchants, who distributed materials (both bowls and lacquers) to the artisans who produced the finished wares.
