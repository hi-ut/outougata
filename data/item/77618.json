        "White lead pigment, today called enpaku, introduced to Japan from China. Chinese-made white lead, usually basic carbonate white lead, is known as kara gofun; the Japanese-produced version, comprising primarily compounds of lead chloride, is called yamato gofun. The Shōsō-in term should not be confused with the post-thirteenth-century use of the term gofun to refer to calcium carbonate made from baked and crushed shells, which was often used as a ground coating on statues and as a ground white in paintings.
