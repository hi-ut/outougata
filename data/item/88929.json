        "The True Word sect, founded by Kukai (774-835) early in the ninth century, with one center at Toji in Kyoto and one at Kongobuji on Mt. Koya. Secret words, hand gestures, and cosmic maps (Mandalas) were crucial aspects to obtain enlightenment, as taught in the most popular esoteric text, the Mahavairochana Sutra (Dainichi-kyo in Japanese)."
