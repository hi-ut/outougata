        "Eisai (J.) 栄西, also pronounced Yōsai, and called variously 明庵, 葉上房, 千光法師, Min'an, Hajōbō, Senkō hōshi. Founder of the Rinzai Zen tradition in Japan, Eisai traveled to China twice. Trained originally at Mount Hiei, he suffered persecution in the 1190s due to his efforts to propagate Zen, and responded by writing a treatise in 1198 (興禅護国論 Kōzen gokokuron) explaining the importance of the precepts in Buddhism, Zen's role as protector of the government and realm, and the need for Zen's independence as a school. Through the patronage of the shogunate, he was able to found 建仁寺 Kenninji (1202) in Kyoto and 寿福寺 Jufukuji (1215) in Kamakura by the time of his death in 1215."
