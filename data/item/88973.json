        "The Tendai zasuki is a monk appointment record that covers the Tendai sect's head abbots from Saicho, ending with the appointment of the 247th zasu Koei in 1927. It was compiled from three different sources and contains ample information not only about the head abbots and their ancestry and religious teachers, but also about important events and ceremonies that took place during their tenures. Several important documents otherwise lost, some of which are reprinted in the reputable source collections Heian ibun and Kamakura ibun, are included in the chronicle."
