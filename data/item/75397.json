        "A brief war fought between the court and Kamakura in 1221. Instigated by the Dharma emperor Go-Toba, the conflict resulted in his sudden defeat. After this war, Kamakura bolstered its presence in Kyoto, and also became responsible for determining succession to the throne. The Saionji family gained great power after Jokyu because alone among courtier families, they sided with Kamakura during the war, and then became the transmitter of messages between the court and Kamakura. See also moshitsugi."
