        "upāyakauśalya. The varying methods used by buddhas and bodhisattvas to apply the Dharma (hō, q. v.) to the specific needs and biases of the individual in his search for enlightenment, rather than prescribing the same remedy for different spiritual ailments. The Absolute (Law Body,\" hosshin; see sanshin entry) ultimately cannot be defined by any conceptual formulation or symbolic representation; yet such provisional signs, forms, myths, and mental constructs can serve as Skillful Means to direct our attention to the Unconditioned, as a finger may point to the moon. The doctrine is conspicuous in the arguments and parables of the Lotus Sutra, and is the basis for Buddhism's (and Mujū's) tolerance of logically conflicting systems. See also honji suijaku and kyōgen kigo entries. [法、本地垂迹、狂言綺語]\""
