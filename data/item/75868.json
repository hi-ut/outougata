        "A meeting of the senior nobles in which they took a question handed to them by the tennō or the retired tennō, met in a room, and gave their opinions on the matter. The meetings were differentiated either by where they were held (as in the case of a Jin no Sadame (Meeting at the Guardpost) or by the substance of the question at hand.  The result of this meeting was not a final decision of court policy, but rather a document, called a sadamebumi, which listed the various opinions. In the case of a question handed down by a tennō, this was passed to the head of the Royal Secretariat, who in turn memorialized it to the throne. [天皇、陣定]"
