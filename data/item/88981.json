        "The diary of Konoe Kanetsune (1210-1259), who was the fourth head of the Konoe line of the Fujiwara clan. He served as regent for Shijo (1237- 1242), Go-saga (1242/1-3), and Go-Fukakusa (1247-1252), deeply involved in the competition for the headship of the Fujiwara with Kujo Michiie. It is believed that Kanetsune kept a diary for most of his life, perhaps from 1222 to 1257 (when he took Buddhist vows), but the last five years as well as many parts in between are missing."
