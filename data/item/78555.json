        "The outer garment ordinarily worn by a courtier at court or fully dressed at home.  The dress cloak and the formal cloak (hō) were ample, straight garments tied at the neck, and with the front and back joined at the hem by a circular band of cloth (ran), pressed flat.  However, the color of a dress cloak was not determined by the wearer’s rank.  It could be made of a single layer of sheer, dark cloth in summer and of light coloured, lined cloth in winter.  It was generally worn with gathered trousers (sashinuki).[袍][襴][指貫][RK]"
