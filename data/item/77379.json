        "The standard unit of measuring length in the Nara period was the Tempyō shaku (29.6 cm), which was based on the Tang-dynasty equivalent, the chi (also 29.6 cm). One shaku is made up of ten sun, and one sun comprises ten bu. The kane shaku (30.3 cm) used today in Japan is longer than its predecessor. [寸、分、曲尺]"
