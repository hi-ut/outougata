        "A discussion conducted by the nobility at the palace of the retired tennō. Originally, such discussions concerned the household policies of the retired tennō, but in 1107, after the ascension of Toba Tennō, countrywide policies came to be discussed. Members were not limited to those of the royal family. [天皇、鳥羽天皇]"
