        "The lower overthrowing those above.A historical term that describes the social and political upheavals that started in the late Kamakura period, before becoming a nationwide trend and problem in the fourteenth century. Signs of this trend can be found within the major religious institutions as early as the late Heian period, when lower-ranking monks began to oppose their increasingly distant noble abbots."
