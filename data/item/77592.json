        "In the Kamakura era, a constable\" responsible for investigating crimes, suppressing rebellion and organizing gokenin for guard duty. This position, originally held by warriors lacking particular local power, became the focus of ambitious warriors after the promulgation of the hanzei edicts. Prior to 1351, military powers accrued more to generals (taishō) but in later half of the fourteenth century shugo became incipient local magnates because they could directly extract economic surpluses for the waging of war.
