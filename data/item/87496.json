        "Historical period named for the location of the shogunal residence in Kyoto; also known as the Ashikaga period, after the warrior house that held the post of shogun from 1338 to 1573. No consensus has been reached regarding when the government gained and lost its legitimacy or effectiveness, and therefore the dates corresponding to this period are a subject of debate.
