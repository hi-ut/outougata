        "[This free-standing screen] stood at the main entrance [of the Emperor's Residence (Seiryōden)], under the eastern outer eaves.  Both sides of the screen were covered with minute inscriptions listing the major annual Court ceremonies and rituals.  Corrections were inserted from time to time, and new screens were made on several occasions (p. 843). [清涼殿]"
