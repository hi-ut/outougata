        "There is no doubt that there existed urban territorial communities with religious functions close to those of village shrine guilds (miyaza 宮座) in the early medieval period (from the eleventh to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries): but territorially based townships (chō 町) which made up the self-governing cities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were strictly urban in nature and cannot be equated with village guilds.
