        "Honorable housemen, a social status drawn from the ranks of provincials who served Minamoto Yoritomo in the 1180s. Gokenin status became predicated upon the performance of guard duty and the possession of edicts (kudashibumi) from Kamakura. The advantages of this status were initially unclear, but as time psaaed, privileges, codified by Kamakura law, accrued to gokenin. By the mid-thirteenth century, the benefits associated with gokenin status outweighed the burdens of guard duty. Thereupon, the most ambitious men of the provinces aspired to become gokenin. No iron-clad method existed of determining who was in fact a gokenin. This term continued to be used after the fall of the Kamakura bakufu, but it generally became replaced by the term kokujin or tozama. [源頼朝、下文、幕府、国人、外様]"
