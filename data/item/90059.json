        "Perhaps the busiest of [Seiryōden's] rooms, where kugyō and tenjōbito met to shine in the reflected glory of the Imperial presence.  The apartment's sparse furnishings consisted chiefly of the Imperial Chair (goishi), the courtiers' duty-board (nikkyū no fuda), and some lacquered dining tables and other objects.  Its most celebrated appurtenance was the Partition of the Annual Ceremonies (Nenjū Gyōji no Sōji) (p. 843). [清涼殿、公卿、殿上人、御椅子、日給簡、年中行事障子]"
