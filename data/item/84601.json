        "Held in the fourth month at the Kamo Shrine. It focused on two central events: the preliminary progress of the Kamo virgin from the imperial palace to the Kamo River, where she performed a purification ritual; and, on the day itself, the procession of the virgin, the imperial messenger, and a gorgeous retinue through the capital to the shrine. A special feature was the use of katsura and aoi-vine leaves to decorate the participants' costumes and the spectators' houses, viewing stands, and carriages. For a brief description, see McCullough 1968: 245-247. [Also known as the Aoi-matsuri 葵祭]"
