        "An officially recognized household led by a high-ranking householder. According to the ritsuryō codes and subsequent legislation, high rankers were given significant household staffs at the expense of the royal treasury, and their primary heirs (chakushi) were to be allowed to enter the bureaucracy significantly above the rank of initiate. To preserve these perquisites through generations, high rankers began designating heirs and thereby established their own stem lineages. Each of Fujiwara Fuhito's four sons, for instance, created his own household and chose a senior heir. [律令、嫡子、藤原不比等]"
