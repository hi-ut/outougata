        "Sometimes translated as an exorcist,\" this term refers to charismatic monks famed for their ritual efficacy. This designation described skill in ritual performance, but did not constitute an appointed office. Those who prayed for emperors became known as \"honorable geza\" or \"public geza\" (kō 公験者) from the mid-thirteenth century onward.\""
