        "A weave structure with polychrome warps arranged in vertical band-like units in a limited number of colors-the yarns of which float alternately on the surface to create a pattern-and two monochrome wefts, a binding weft that forms the weave structure (primarily twill in the Shōsō-in) and a hidden secondary or pattern weft (sometimes comprising two yarns per shot) that functions to hold down all colored warps but the one floating on the surface at any given point. Warp-faced varieties are the most ancient compound weaves, dating to Han dynasty China, but due to their complexity and the difficulty of weaving with any more than three of four colors at a time, they were gradually replaced by weft-faced weaves in the early Tang dynasty. Also read keikin."
