        "Held on or about the fiftieth day after a birth.  Using chopsticks, the father or maternal grandfather fed the baby from an assortment of fifty special rice cakes (ika no mochii), probably as a formal indication that the infant's diet would thenceforth include solid food.  The event, which took place at night, was accompanied by an elaborate banquet at which the guests composed poems predicting long life for the child (p. 76n). [五十日の餅]"
