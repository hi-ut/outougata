        "Eleventh shogun (1787-1837). The eleventh shogun's rule was divided into two parts.  It began when the shogun was still a minor.  During his early years he served as legitimizer for the reform-minded Matsudaira Sadanobu (1758-1829) who mounted what has been called the Kansei Reforms\" dedicated to cleaning up what he believed to be the evil influences of Tanuma [Okitsugu].  In 1817, however, Ienari found himself free of influence from conservative members of the bakufu senior officialdom.  There followed a period of conspicuous spending under Grand Chamberlain Mizuno Tadaakira (p. 21). [松平定信、寛政改革、田沼意次、水野忠成]\""
