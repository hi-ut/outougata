        "Buddhist banners made of openwork gilt bronze or cloth generally have triangular heads,\" elongated \"bodies,\" and dangling \"legs.\" The shape, thought to derive from military flags in ancient India, developed into insignias of Buddhist temples with the propagation of Buddhism. Hanging from posts inside or outside temples, they functioned as offerings to Buddhas and other deities, and as decorations for rituals.\""
