        "The outer garment worn by men on official business and when participating in court ceremonies.   The formal cloak was not a layering (kasane) but was made either of an opaque cloth with a figure worked into it in the same or nearly the same color, or of a single layer of sheer cloth.  Its colour matched the wearer’s rank in the time of the tale.[襲][RK]"
