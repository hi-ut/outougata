        "Hōjo (J.) 法助, also called 開田准后、開田御室 Kaiden jukō, Kaiden omuro. Son of the chancellor and regent Kujō Michiie (1193-1252), he studied first under the prince-monk 道深 Dōjin (1206-49) at Ninnaji, receiving the denbō kanjō in 1243. At the same time, insofar as Dōjin was also an heir to Hanjun's line in the Ono branch, Hōjo was also an heir to the same line. Hōjo retired to the Ninnaji sub-temple Kaiden'in in 1258, and taught there until his death in 1284. Among his disciples were Raijo and the illustrious monk 禅助 Zenjo (1247-1330)."
