        "Literally meaning tent government,\" this term describes three warrior governments of Japan: the Kamakura (1185-1333), Muromachi or Ashikaga (1338-1573) and Tokugawa (1603-1867) regimes. A shōgun, or \"barbarian-subduing generalissimo,\" headed each bakufu. Kamakura possessed judicial authority, appointed shugo and jitō, and mobilized gokenin for guard duty (ōban'yaku). The Ashikaga continued many Kamakura policies, but after 1351 they delegated considerable powers to the shugo. [鎌倉、室町、足利、徳川、将軍、守護、地頭、御家人、大番役]\""
