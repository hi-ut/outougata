        "Rituals of destruction, practiced by Shingon and Tendai priests, in order to destroy those who cannot be saved,\" and by extension, enemies of the state. The Ninnōkyō sutra provided the scriptural authority for these prayers of destruction, designed to preserve and protect the state, that were offered to five potent Buddhist deities, the \"wisdom kings\" Fudō, Gozanze, Gundari, Dai-i-toku-ten and Kongi. These prayers were performed by five ranking priests, from noble families, who individually burned offerings (goma) and chanted prayers to these deities, each of which was believed to destroy malevolence--be it hostile emotions, \"evil spirits\" or inhospitable aspects of the natural world. Although these rituals were primarily a prerogative of the court, they increasingly were patronized by the Ashikaga shōguns. See also ōbō, buppō, and godanhō.
