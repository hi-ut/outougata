        "Dainichi (Nyorai) (J.) 大日（如来）, also referred to as 摩訶毘廬遮那、大遍照如来, 遍照如来, 最高顕広明眼蔵如来, 無量無辺究竟如来, 広博身如来, 一切法自在牟尼, Makabirushana, Daihenjō Nyorai, Henjō Nyorai, Saikōkenkōmyōgenzō Nyorai, Muryōmuhenkukyō Nyorai, Kōbakushi Nyorai, Issaijizaimuni. Originally viewed as a wheel-turning king or lord of titans, Dainichi (Sk. Mahāvairocana) came in Mahāyāna Buddhism to be seen as an absolute or cosmic form of Buddha. In esoteric Buddhism, Dainichi is the primary object of veneration, particulary in uses of the Diamond and Womb Realm mandalas. Iconographically, Dainichi often bear clothing and implements of a king rather than those associated with Buddhas. In Japan, Dainichi was known since the Nara era, since the Kegon school held the Buddha Vairocana as its central object of veneration, and was prominent in the form of the Great Rushana Buddha at Tōdaiji. Famous figures as Dainichi were those constructed at Kongōbuji (Kōyasan), Enjōji (Ninnikusen), Kōryūji, and Dōganji in the Heian era. Dainichi, from the Heian era on, was often associated with the Kami of the sun, Amaterasu, and with the increasing assimilation of Kami and Buddhas, was conceived of as the essence of Amaterasu in theories of Ryōbu Shintō and others in the medieval period."
