        "to commend land to a high-ranking noble or influential religious institution that could guarantee the tax-exempt status of the land, and its safety from confiscation by provincial authorities. By the eleventh century many estates (shôen  荘園 ) were established by acts of commendation initiated by local land openers (zaichi ryôshu). Modern historians call such estates kishin shôen 寄進 荘園.
