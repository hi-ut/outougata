        "Go-shichinichi mishiho (J.) 後七日御修法, also pronounced Go-shichinichi mishuhō, and called simply Mishiho/mishuhō on occasion. Latter Seven-Day Rite, originally performed under the name of mishuhō by Kūkai in the Central Affairs Ministry (Nakatsukasa shō) of the greater palace in 834, it was thereafter performed in the Shingon chapel (Shingon'in) which he established in the palace from the 8th to 14th of the first month of each year. The purpose of the rite, which was with the exception of illness always led by the abbot of Tōji. Due to the political problems in the Muromachi era, the rite was ceased, but in 1623, it was revived, and continued until the suppression of court Buddhist rituals in 1871. In 1883, the rite was again revived, but was moved to Tōji 灌頂院 Kanjō'in; from that time forward, the mikusuri kaji rite, which traditionally was performed in the imperial residence in the palace, is conducted using only the imperial robes."
