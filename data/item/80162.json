        "One of the family chapels of the Fujiwara clan, established by 兼家 Kane'ie (929-90) in his home in the area between Kyōgoku and Nijō in Kyoto the year of his death. Although a subtemple of the family temple 積善寺 Sekizenji in Yoshida, the latter was moved next to Hōkō'in in 994. The chapel/temple was the site of many assemblies and other rites in the Heian era."
