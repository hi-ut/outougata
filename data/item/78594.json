        "The highest non-imperial office (second rank) provided for in the government’s formal table of organization, as the office of Chancellor was not; however, the post of Palace Minister (Naidaijin, Uchi no Otodo) was also a later addition.  The Minister of the Left (Sadaijin, Hidari no Otodo) was normally but not necessarily senior to the Minister of the Right (Udaijin, Migi no Otodo), and the Palace Minister was somewhat junior in standing.[内大臣、左大臣、右大臣][RK]"
