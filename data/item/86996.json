        "(1732-1817) Brother of Chikuzan.  Riken used the evolutionary framework to disagree with what the previous generation, including Chikuzan, had said, namely, that the history of the previous five hundred years had resulted in the virtuous Tokugawa regime....  Although Riken retained intact the evolutionary perspective, he had sharply altered the interpretive intent into an indictment of received history...[and] framed [the Tokugawa shogunate] as the culmination of a vast conspiracy and incessant betrayal (p. 644).
