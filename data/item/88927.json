        "The Regent's Line of the Fujiwara clan, which evolved from the Northern Fujiwara (the hokke) branch. The sekkanke monopolized the offices of regent (sessho) and chancellor (kanpaku), through which the head also served as the chieftain of the Fujiwara clan. The sekkanke was gradually divided, however, from the thirteenth century, resulting in a decline of support from and loyalty within the clan."
