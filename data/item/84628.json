        "A ceremony for girls comparable to the capping for boys, performed around the age of puberty. A woman's formal train (mo), symbolizing adulthood, was put in place, and its sash tied, by an officiant called a koshiyui, who was usually an older female relative or a prominent member of the aristocracy. See McCullough and McCullough 1980: 412-413. [腰結ひ]"
