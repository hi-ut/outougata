        "Exoteric and esoteric. Kenmitsu\" was the combined term for the six Nara schools and the two Heian sects (Tendai and Shingon). Tendai and Shingon were particularly popular in the late Heian and Kamakura periods, since they combined exoteric (ken) scriptures with esoteric (mitsu), orally transmitted rituals in their teachings. Kuroda Toshio claimed that the kenmitsu teachings were the ideological paradigm from the early Heian to the mid-Muromachi era.\""
