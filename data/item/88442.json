        "One of the phases of daimyō evolution as conceived by modern historians. A warrior in the post-Ōnin War period having control over a large area, and who held this power independently of the bakufu or shōen systems. The possession of the post of shugo was not a necessary prerequisite, but the daimyō of the Sengoku period often laid claim to such rank as a means of legitimation of local military rule.　[応仁の乱、幕府、荘園、守護]"
