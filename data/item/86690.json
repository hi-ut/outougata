        "By Sōchiku (Mitsui Takahira).  [A]n account of the downfall of some fifty merchant houses, almost all in Kyoto, and the lessons to be drawn from the disastrous consequences of lending to daimyo, speculating in currency and commodities, living luxuriously, collecting expensive antiques, mixing with court nobles or noh actors, becoming too engrossed in religion and giving buildings to gemples, and, in any variety of ways, forgetting one's proper station (p. 766). [宗竺、三井高平]"
