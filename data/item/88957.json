        "Taira no Nobunori's (1112-1187) diary, covering the period from 1132 to 1171. Though not as detailed as the Gyokuyo, perhaps lacking the kind of insight that Kanezane had since Nobunori was a mid-ranking courtier serving the sekkanke, it is an extremely valuable source for the Hogen and Heiji incidents. Nobunori was also made scapegoat in 1169 during the Narichika Incident but was recalled in 1171, owing to Kiyomori's intervention."
