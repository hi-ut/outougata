        "Gōhō (J.) 杲宝, with the original clerical name of 弘基 Kōki. Monk who founded the 観智院 Kanchi'in at Tōji and who was known for his vast studies and extremely voluminous writings. Entering Tōji at a young age, he first studied Shingon doctrine and ritual under the powerful monk 頼宝 Raihō (1279-1330), and soon after received consecration in the Sanbō'in lineage of the Ono branch from 浄宝 Jōhō of Makiosan. He also went to study problems of nature and form in Nara (性相学 shōzōgaku, presumably of the Hossō and/or Kusha schools), and studied esoteric doctrine at Kōyasan in the 1320s. In 1346, he received denbō kanjō from 栄海 Yōkai (1278-1347) at Kajūji Jison'in, and continued to study doctrine and ritual, though now under 性心 Shōshin (1287-1357) at Kongōju'in (Wakakusa). Famous for his academic abilities, Gōhō wrote lengthy treatises on a variety of topics, the discussions therein make it clear that he studied under a whole series of teachers greater in number than is indicated in traditional biography. His works 東宝記 Tōbō ki and 杲宝私鈔 Gōhō shishō are especially valuable, respectively, for the information they concerning the history and rituals of Tōji and esoteric studies of his day."
