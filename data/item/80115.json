        "Reputed last testament of Kūkai given to his disciples at the time of his death. The term usually refers to the 25-article version, which dates to the 10th c. if not earlier; however, a number of related works have also been handed down in Shingon tradition. Most famous are 御手印縁起 Goshuin engi and 承和遺誡 Jōwa yuikai."
