        "The entry-level Academy examination in the letters (kiden) line of study.  It covered Chinese history as contained in the Shiji and the Hanshu.   Passing three of its five parts gave the student “provisional candidate” (gimonjō) status, that is, qualified him to become (after a further, “Ceremonial Bureau examination” [shikibu no tsukasa no kokoromi]), a regular candidate (monjōshō) for the Academy's first full degree.[紀伝、擬文章、式部省試、文章生][RK]"
