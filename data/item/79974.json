        "The younger brother of the shōgun Takauji (1305-1358), Tadayoshi was particularly active as the figure in the early Ashikaga shogunate who oversaw legal and other administrative proceedings, and who governed large areas of eastern Japan, as opposed to Takauji, who had control of the military and was resident in Kyoto.  Although he was able to defeat his rivals in battle, Tadayoshi often had differences with Takauji over shogunate policy and approach which together with related antipathy between their parties led to a rift impossible to solve.  Returning from battle to Kamakura in 1352, Tadayoshi was killed, presumably poisoned by Takauji's forces."
