        "Governor of Chekiang Province [who was] appointed with the clear mandate to eliminate Shuang-hsü and other coastal sore spots in his own province as well as in Fukien and northern Kwantung.  From the official Ming standpoint, the traders who gathered at such anchorages were either outlaws guilty of high treason or barbarian brigands (p. 252)."
