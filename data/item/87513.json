        "A series of wars fought intermittently in and around Kyoto over a period of eleven years (1467-77) between western\" and \"eastern\" forces, loose coalitions of shugo daimyo led respectively by politically and militarily strong shugo daimyo, the Hosokawa and Yamana. Often referred to as the Ōnin-Bummei disturbances by Japanese scholars (from the period names of these eleven years), these wars ushered in a century of civil war known as the Sengoku (literally, \"warring states\") period. Although the ostensible cause for the Ōnin War was a dispute over the selection of a new shogun, the real cause of the war was the decline in the authority and power of the Ashikaga bakufu and the rise of the shugo daimyo as regional military powers who challenged the political stability of the bakufu. The war was prolonged because of the individual ambitions of the leading shugo daimyo and fluctuations in their coalitions. Specialists continue to debate the specific political and economic motivations of the shugo daimyo and their vassals, as well as of the civil elites who were also involved.
