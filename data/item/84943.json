        "a system of rice-seed lending. The ritsuryō Law on Miscellaneous Matters noted that 50 percent interest was to be collected for publicly distributed rice seed. The use of public rice lending increased dynamically in the early eighth century, and particularly during the Tempyō age. Seed was distributed by the provincial headquarters in spring and summer. Initially, interest was charged at the stipulated 50 percent, but was later reduced to 30 percent. Proceeds paid the salaries of provincial staff and were also used to purchase goods to be sent to the capital. Profits from suiko are known to have been used to pay for the construction of the Shigaraki and Tōdaiji Buddha images. Stories in the Nihon ryōiki 日本霊異記 also indicate the frequency of private lending of rice seed by local elites, which practice the tennō's government attempted to prohibit on several occasions.
