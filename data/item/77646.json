        "An embroidery stitch used to fill in areas with color for pictorial renderings, it constitutes the basic stitch for many Nara-period embroidery pieces and also embroidery after the sixteenth century. First the needle works from the outlines of the figure towards the center in long and short stitches, and then a second layer of alternating long and short stitches are again worked towards the center of the figure. The term sashinui can also mean the quilting together of multiple layers of cloth by stitching through all the layers."
