        "In the Nara and Heian periods, the security of the Palace and the Imperial Family were matters of continuing concern--a concern reflected in the frequent early reorganizations of the major guard groups, in the existence by mid-Heian of numerous small special security units, and in the assingment of extremely large numbers of men to patrol and escort duties.  The organizations of this type that figure most prominently in Heian texts are the Six Guards Headquarters, which consisted of the Left and Right Bodyguards (Sakon'efu, Ukon'efu), the Left and Right Military Guards (Sahyōefu, Uhyōefu), and the Left and Right Gate Guards (Saemonfu, Uemonfu) (p. 812).
