        "Hachiman (Dai) bosatsu (J.) 八幡（大）菩薩, the characters 八幡 sometimes pronounced Yahata. This was the first known deity (kami) resident in a shrine (jinja) who was identified as a bodhisattva (or any other Buddhist figure for that matter). The first references to Hachiman were in connection with Usa shrine in the 8th c., and the oracles of Hachiman were seen as indispensable to the accessions of new sovereigns from the mid-8th c. on, related in part to the belief that Hachiman was the spirit of the former sovereign Ōjin (r. 270-310). By at least the early 9th c., Hachiman was also seen as a bodhisattva, the shrine in Usa was the object of tri-annual offerings of treasures (jinpō) from the imperial house, and the latter site was seen as an ancestral mausoleum (sōbyō) of the imperial clan."
