        "(1171-1244) A member of one of the minor Fujiwara branches, Kintsune started out as a mid-level courtier before reaching the top echelons in 1198. Since he opposed Go-Toba's failed uprising against the Kamakura Bakufu of 1221 (the Jokyu War), Kintsune quickly rose through the ranks. He was promoted to Grand Minister (daijo daijin), served as the court liaison (Kanto moshitsugi) with the bakufu, and saw his son-in-law, Kujo Yoritsune, become the fourth shogun of the Kamakura Bakufu."
