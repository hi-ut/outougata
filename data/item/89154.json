        "Although it was possible to receive an official appointment at any time during the year, the normal expectation was that the individual's name would appear on one of the semiannual lists, either in the spring, when the emphasis was on filling provincial vacancies, or in the autumn, when most of the central appoinments took place (p. 384)."
