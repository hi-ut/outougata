        "Discontinuous wefts work back and forth in the area of any given color. The wefts of the plainweave are set so densely as to totally hide the warps, which lends clarity to the outlines of the motifs. Where the wefts of two colors meet, they may be interlocked or double back without interlocking, forming a vertical slit."
