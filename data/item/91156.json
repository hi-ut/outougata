        "The land rent collected by prominent local holders (shiryōshu) from resident cultivators. Viewed as a kind of on-the-land nengu, alongside the regular nengu owed to the shōen proprietor. Commendation transactions antecedent to a shōen incorporation often strengthened the commender's right to kajishi.　[私領主、年貢、荘園]"
