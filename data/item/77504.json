        "Reference to a law passed in 1351, whereby half of a province's revenue was earmarked for the procurement of provisions and military supplies. This marks the first direct and sustained linkage of the ability to extract economic resources with the mobilization of military forces. This provisional tax became institutionalized, and served as the basis for shugo asserting rights to provincial revenue. With the hanzei, the post of shugo became coveted by aspiring magnates. [守護]"
