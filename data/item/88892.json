        "(1137-1177) Narichika was a career commander with ambitions within the imperial court. As a twenty-two-year-old, he sided with Fujiwara no Nobuyori in the Heiji Disturbance of 1159-1160 against both Go-Shirakawa and Taira no Kiyomori. Narichika escaped execution because of his marriage to Kiyomori's daughter, but he was stripped of his offices. He was reinstated in 1161but was immediately involved in another incident centering on the newly born Prince Tadahito (Go-Shirakawa's seventh son, later Emperor Takakura, who ruled 1168-1180), resulting in his exile. Narichika was pardoned the following year and, resuming his career as a hired sword, received Owari as a proprietary province in 1166. He was Enryakuji's main opponent in a dispute over land in Owari in 1169 and sided against the temple and Taira no Kiyomori in 1176-1177."
