        "The designated heir to a family headship, though not necessarily the eldest son. Until late Kamakura times the chakushi and his brothers and sisters generally divided the family's wealth according to the specifications laid down in their father's final testament. A trend toward unitary inheritance began in the late thirteenth century."
