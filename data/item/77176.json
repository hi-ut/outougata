        "A type of plain-weave silk textile. The ashiginu in the Shōsō-in came to the national government as tax cloth from provinces across Japan. Originally, the term referred to poor-quality cloth woven in Japan, as opposed to finer textiles imported from China. Over time, however, the quality of domestic silk production increased and the discrepancies between the two conutries disappeared. [Also see hiraori 平織] [正倉院]"
