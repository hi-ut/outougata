        "The senior appointee to Dazaifu, the government outpost in Kyushu that was particularly responsible for such foreign relations as Japan had at the time.  The post (junior third rank) was held by a Prince.  Since it was a sinecure, and the incumbent never actually went to Kyushu, the real government representative there was the Dazaifu Deputy.[大宰府、九州][RK]"
