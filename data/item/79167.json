        "This method of red lacquering involves staining the base red and then coating with transparent lacquer. It was widely used in the Nara period on woodwork, as well as on woven basketry. This differs from another method of red lacquering (shuurushi) in which vermillion is mixed into the transparent lacquer before application. [朱漆]"
