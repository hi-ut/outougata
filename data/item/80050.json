        "Fa-hsien (Ch.) 法顕. Chinese monk who traveled to India, Central Asia and Sri Lanka for a period lasting from 399 to 414. The record he produced, usually called 高僧法顕伝 Kao-seng fa-hsien chuan, was the first of its kind in the Chinese Buddhist community, affording the reader insights into the religious and social life of the places he visited which could not otherwise be ascertained. Later, he translated some scptures together with Buddhabhadra."
