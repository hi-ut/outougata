        "The conflict in 1159 in which the anti-Shinzei and anti-insei faction among the nobles (the Fujiwara courtiers Tsunemune, Nobuyori, and Korekata) were joined by the disaffected Minamoto warrior chieftain Yoshitomo, a bitter enemy of his military rival, Taira no Kiyomori, and of Shinzei, to contemplate a coup to topple Shinzei and Kiyomori.  Although the plotters managed to kill Shinzei, the rebellion ended with the victory of Kiyomori's troops (p. 622). [,藤原信西、藤原信頼、源義朝、平清盛]"
