        "noble titles granted by the Yamato ruler to those who served him. Such titles-examples include omi 臣, muraji 連, sukune 宿禰, miyatsuko 造, kimi 公, atai 直, and obito 首-were subsequently used by those descended from the original recipient, that is, members of his lineage. Reception of a kabane provided the foundation for establishment of an uji. Most historians think that the kabane system was in place in the fifth century, and it continued to serve as a tool for configuring court and realm through Great King Temmu's day. Temmu created new kabane titles, such as mahito 真人, and reordered older ones. [氏、天武]"
