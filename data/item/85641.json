        "The word ton'ya (and its variants, toiya and don'ya) designated a broad and diverse class of merchants in Tokugawa Japan, usually with some degree of monopoly privileges. Some operated as wholesalers, consignment agents, or receiving agents; others supervised procesing industries; still others oversaw shipping concerns. It is the latter that are of interest here: brokerage houses engaged in cargo shipping, known locally as horse or cargo ton'ya (umadon'ya or nidon'ya). Like their conterparts in wholesaling, cargo ton'ya were typically licensed by the local authorities to collect tolls (kôsen) on each transaction, in exchange for which they usually paid licensing fees (unjōkin) to local officials.
