        "A mourning hut, used for temporary sequestration of the corpse and as a site of public mourning rites. The custom is described in records concerning the later sixth-century Yamato court, which buried Great King Kimmei and his heirs with increasing ceremonial fanfare. Associated funerary practices were adopted from Chinese ritual handbooks such as the Book of Rites and the Rites of Chou, including public mourning and eulogizing. [欽明]"
