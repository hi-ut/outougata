        "Chin-kuang ming tsui-sheng-wang ching (Ch.) 金光明最勝王経, often referred to as Konkōmyōkyō (金光明経). One of the so-called 3 nation-protecting scriptures in Japan. An early translation of which was known in the 7th c. court, the translation by I-ching (義浄 J. Gijō) was the object of recitation and lecture at the palace 御斎会 Misai-e since its inception in the 760s, in the belief that veneration of the scripture would ensure protection of the state and country by the 4 heavenly kings (shitennō) who guard the cardinal directions. For the same reason, the name of the provincial temples (the so-called kokubunji) was Konkōmyō shitennō gokoku no tera (金光明四天王護国之寺), and recitation and lecture on the scripture was the primary ritual focus."
