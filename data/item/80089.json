        "Genyu (J.) 元瑜, also called 大弐, 成遍 Daini, Jōhen. A monk of the Nishi-no-in lineage of the Hirosawa branch of Shingon, Genyu was originally trained in Hossō at Yakushiji (Nara), after which he went to Kamakura Muryōjuji and received the denbō kanjō from 宏教 Kōgyō (1184-1255) of the Nishi-no-in lineage. Founding his own line of the Nishi-no-in and heir as well to the Ninnaji Hoju'in lineage (Hirosawa), in the 1280s he was initiated into the Ninnaji 御流 gory・ (Hirosawa) and Daigo (Ono) lineages by Raijo. He also had a stint as abbot of Tsurugaoka Hachimang・shrine in Kamakura, and thus had close ties with the shogunate."
