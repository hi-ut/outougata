        "a Chinese term denoting a particularly trusted minister. In Japan, in 887 the scholar-official Tachibana Hiromi (837-90), who was closely allied with Uda Tennô, proposed that Fujiwara Mototsune be given the title of akô. He thereby initiated debate over the proper role and title for the leading minister at court. Tachibana lost the debate when Fujiwara Mototsune’s authority over the Council of State (Daijôkan), as viceroy (kampaku) rather than as akô, was confirmed. [太政官］ [関白]"
