        "The Office of Monastic Affairs. The sogo was a government organ established in 624 for the purpose of supervising all Buddhist sects, monks, and nuns. Its responsibilities included ordinations, registration of monks, and reviewing the rules for each sect. The court staffed the sogo with high-ranking monks of its own choice, even though nominations were made by a monk's teacher or his temple, based on his services within the temple and merits accumulated through the perfomance of prestigious Buddhist rituals for the imperial court. The composition of the sogo tended to reflect the political balance among the different sects, but it was in particular dominated by Hosso monks in the early Heian age."
