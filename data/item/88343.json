        "Manager or custodian of a shōen. Later, the ryōke's deputy. Often the major commender of the land would be given this title, especially when he was not in the highest ranks of the nobility. He would then be virtual proprietor (ryōke), ranking only lower than the guarantor (honke). (See Mass, Kamakura bakufu)　[荘園、領家、本家]"
