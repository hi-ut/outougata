        "Hōkyōin darani (J.) 宝篋印陀羅尼, also referred to as 一切如来心秘密全身舎利宝篋印陀羅尼 Issai nyorai shin himitsu zenshin shari hōkyōin darani. Dhāraṇī praising the relics of all Buddhas which is commonly uttered or written in esoteric Buddhism, invoking the power of relics to eliminate transgressions and prevent calamity. When written, it is usually placed in a so-called hōkyōin-tō reliquary. Such reliquaries have been interpreted in a variety of ways in China and Japan. In Japan, for example, the Sanbō'in line of the Ono branch of Shingon has viewed the enshrined text as a Buddha relic which should be understood to be a wish-fulfilling jewel. In practice, the hōkyōin darani, the scripture on which it s based (Issai nyorai shin hitsu zenshin shari hōkyōin darani kyō), or grains of rice--a famous case being the mini-stūpas of rice 籾塔 momitō conructed at Murōji--were placed in the reliquaries, usually together with additional sanskrit root syllables for the 4 Buddhas surrounding Dainichi in the Diamond realm mandala. The fact that, at least in the case of the Sanbō'in line, Śākyamuni was seen as the object of veneration, illustrates how closely intertwined worship of Śākyamuni was with that of Dainichi in early medieval Japanese Buddhism. The verbal practice of the dhāraṇī was common in both Tendai and Shingon from early on, and was especially prominent in rites they performed for the dead which were sponsored by aristocrats from the late Heian era on."
