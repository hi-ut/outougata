        "By this method of creating multiple Buddhist figures, a sheet of metal, usually copper, is placed onto a forged metal mold and then hammered until it takes on the shape of the mold. This was a common way to produce decorative figures for temples, portable shrines and private altars in the Asuka and Nara periods (7th and 8th centuries)."
