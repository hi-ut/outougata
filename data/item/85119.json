        "Linked verse.Renga sequences were often composed by two poets alternately (or consecutively) writing 5-7-5 and 7-7 syllable links of verse and stringing them together. This form of verse can be found as early as the Heian period (794-1185) and reached its height after the fourteenth century.［平安］"
