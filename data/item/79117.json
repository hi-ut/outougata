        "Also called Kuregaku, this form of masked dance, theater,and music originated in China and was performed al fresco. Gigaku was performed at the Daibutsu Kaigen-e (Consecration Ceremony of the Great Buddha) on 9 April 752. For this reason the Shōsō-in contains a large and precious collection of gigaku masks, costumes, hand drums (kure tsuzumi) , and other instruments. [呉楽・娯楽、大仏開眼会、正倉院、呉鼓]"
