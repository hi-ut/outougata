        "Hizō hōyaku (J.) 秘蔵寶鑰, also called simply 寶鑰 Hōyaku or 略論 Ryakuron (in contra-distinction to the work 十住心論 Jūjūshinron, which is then called 広論 Kōron). Treatise written by Kūkai late in his life, explaining his notion of 10 levels of Buddhist understanding in concise fashion, as opposed to Jūjūshinron, which presents the same views in much greater depth."
