        "“A member of the Minamoto (gen) clan (ji).”  A first generation Genji, or Minamoto, was a man who, like the Genji of the tale, had been  excluded from the imperial family by having been given a surname and so made a commoner; and, by extension in the tale’s usage, a non-Fujiwara (especially an imperial) aspirant to a position normally considered the prerogative of the Fujiwara.  The surname Minamoto was first conferred by the Emperor in 814, and many surplus imperial brothers, sons, and grandsons received it thereafter.[源、氏、源氏、藤原][RK]"
