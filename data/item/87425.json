        "Historical period corresponding to the life span of the Kamakura bakufu; named after Kamakura, where the government was located. It is generally agreed that the period ended in 1333, the year the bakufu was destroyed. Alternative dates, however, have been proposed to mark its beginning, such as 1180, the year Minamoto Yoritomo established his base at Kamakura, or 1185, when the Minamoto conclusively defeated the rival Taira at the battle of Dannoura, or 1192, the year the imperial court gave official recognition to the de facto military rule of Minamoto Yoritomo by conferring on him the title of shogun."
