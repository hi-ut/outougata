        "One of two lutes (biwa) imported from China, which came to be considered as constituting some of the regalia of office. Genjo was the more favored instrument because only emperors were, in ideal, allowed to touch it, while only court musicians could play Suzuka. Both instruments were lost in the fourteenth century. See also Suzuka."
