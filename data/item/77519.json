        "A retired emperor's edict, issued from his secretariat and having the force of law. In late thirteenth and early fourteenth century Japan, whether a retired emperor's edict, or a reigning emperor's edict (rinji) possessed the ultimate force of law remained in dispute. Supporters of the emperor Go-Daigo tended to view rinji as being supreme, while the Ashikaga relied more on inzen for legitimation. [綸旨、後醍醐]"
