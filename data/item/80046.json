        "Ennin (J.) 円仁, posthumous name 慈覚大師 Jikaku daishi. First-generation disciple of Tendai founder Saichō, who is best known for his record of pilgrimage to China (838-47) Nittō guhō junrei gyōki. However, he was also the first Tendai monk to acquire extensive training in the esoteric Buddhist traditions of China. He studied at Mount Wu-t'ai and received consecration from leading esoteric monks in Ch'ang-an, returning to establish a Tendai tradition of esotericism (台密 taimitsu) at Enryakuji. He also established a series of new practices such as the relics assembly (shari-e), the Lotus confessional meditation (法華三昧 hokke zanmai), the constant meditation (including recitation of nenbutsu) on Amida (常行三昧 jōgyō zanmai), and the chanting of Buddhist hymns (声明 shōmyō), all of which prominently influenced later practices in medieval Japan."
