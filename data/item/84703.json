        "A unit of the realm of Yamato paramounts from the fifth century onwards. The word may have originally meant donated fields.\" A hereditary chieftain who sent tribute to the Yamato ruler was dubbed an agatanushi　県主. Agata named in extant documents were located west of a frontier made by the eastern borders of Echizen, Mino and Owari, the \"extended core\" of this book, but they were concentrated particularly in mid-Honshū and along the Inland Sea. Many agata later became districts.　[越前、美濃、尾張]　\""
