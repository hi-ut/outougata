        "A felt rug, often with a floral design worked into it. The wool of the rugs in the Shōsō-in comes from Continental strains, both wild and domesticated. To make the multicolored patterns, layers of the various dyed wools would be arranged on a large cloth, water sprinkled over the whole, the cloth rolled up and the wool massaged until the fibers felted with each other.
