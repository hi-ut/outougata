        "A saibara song in dialogue form: \"[The husband] Stay your boat, O cherry blossom man, I've to see to my fields on the island, and I'll be back tomorrow, yes, I'll be back tomorrow!  [The wife]  “Tomorrow, you say, but he who has a woman there won't really be back tomorrow, no, not really back tomorrow.” [催馬楽][RK]"
