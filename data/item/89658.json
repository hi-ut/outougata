        "The Kyōshoden, southwest of the Shishinden and south of the Seiryōden, was used as a headquarters by the members of the Chamberlains' Office, who occupied the western eavechambers.  The building also contained storage facilities for certain books and everyday articles of which the Chamberlains were custodians (p. 848). [紫宸殿、清涼殿]"
