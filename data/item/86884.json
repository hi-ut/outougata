        "Arranged in the topical categories of Chinese and Japanese encyclopedias, [this illustrated lexicon] provided for each of its twelve hundred words the readings, a synomym or line of definition and, in most intances, a drawing.  During the last two decades of the seventeenth century, kimmō zui were published also to teach the vocabulary and rudiments of special subjects:  military equipment, noh drama, the occupations, and flower arranging (pp. 720-721)."
