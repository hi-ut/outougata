        "Special offerings set out for memorial services for Buddhas, bodhisattvas, priests, and dead souls: incense, flowers, lights and food, the first three being basic imperatives. Each historical period is marked by characteristic implements such as incense burners, vases, flower baskets, flower ornaments, candle sticks, and torch baskets."
