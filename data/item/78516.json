The living space extended from the chamber into the aisle (hisashi), which could be partitioned into distinct rooms, and, further into a veranda (sunoko) covered by eaves (noki).  The smaller room of the chamber (nurigome, retreat), if present, could serve for sleeping or as a storeroom.[廂・庇、簀子、軒、塗籠][RK]"
