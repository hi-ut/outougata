        "Zōyakumen estates developed from the tenth century on, when a portion of the obligations peasants owed to the provincial government was exempted, that is, ceded to a temple or shrine.  The form was literally miscellaneous\":  it might mean rice, oil, roof tiles, straw rope, other products, or service labor.  Such estates came under the dual control of provincial government officials and the estate holder (p. 614).\""
