        "the Office of Monastic Affairs, established prior to the ritsuryô codes but confirmed therein as the agency charged with overseeing monastic affairs under the Bureau for Alien and Buddhist Affairs (Genbaryô), the Ministry of Civil Affairs (Jibushô), and the Council of State. Its prelates—initially at the three ranks of sôjô, sôzu, and risshi, but other ranks were added later—were appointed by the tennô from among the best known scholar-monks at official temples. By Heian times its responsibilities became more ritual in nature. Its prelates might also serve as monastic directors (bettô) at official temples. [律令] [玄蕃寮] [治部省] [僧正] [僧都] [律師] [天皇] [別当]"
