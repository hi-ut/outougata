        "Also called Kuregaku, this form of masked dance, theater, and music originated in China and was performed outdoors, Particularly in temple grounds. According to the Chronicles of Japan, it was brought to Japan by a musician and dancer called Mimashi from Paekché (Korea). Gigaku was performed at the Daibutsu Kaigen-e (Consecration Ceremony of the Great Buddha) on the ninth day of the fourth month of 752. For this reason the Shōsō-in contains a large and precious collection of gigaku masks, costumes, hand drums (kure tsuzumi), and other instruments. [呉楽、日本書紀、味摩之、百済、大仏開眼会、正倉院、呉鼓]"
