        "One of the three ecclesiastical ranks that were intended to parallel the three sōgō offices.  We translate their names, hōin (Dharma Sign), hōgen( Dharma Eye), and hokkyō (Dharma Bridge), as His Holiness, the Venerable, and the Reverend.  In theory, the ranks were awarded to recognize distinguished scholarly and moral attainments.  By the late Heian period, such criteria were habitually ignored, and before the foraml abandonment of the system in 1873 the ranks had been conferred on innumerable warriors, physicians, sculptors, artisans, Confucian scholars, and other laymen (p. 397).
