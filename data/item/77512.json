        "A cape designed to physically and spiritually protect warriors. Billowing behind a mounted warrior, horo were thought to deflect arrows. Furthermore, warriors who wore bright crimson horo did so as an expression of their determination to fight to the death. A mandala would be placed in the horo so as to mitigate against the need for a funeral if one died in battle. The horo also served as a shroud for the head of those who had been decapitated."
