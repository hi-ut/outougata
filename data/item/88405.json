        "State or polity. A term originally borrowed from the Chinese, kokka appears as early as Shōtoku Taishi's Seventeen Article Constitution (604), but without the connotation of state. Used by Sengoku daimyō to designate their sphere of political control, I.e., their domain (ryōgoku).　[聖徳太子、憲法十七条、戦国大名、領国]"
