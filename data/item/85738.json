        "Sanskrit: saddharma-vipralopa.　According to scripture, the fortunes of the Buddhist law begin to decline some five hundred years after the death of a buddha. Mappō is the final stage in this decline. During this period it is thought to be difficult for people to attain salvation or enlightenment without either extraordinary effort (according to some analyses) or the grace of a buddha (according to others). Calculations accepted in medieval Japan set the beginning of mappō at A.D. 1052."
