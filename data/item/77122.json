        "the Heavenly Sovereign, one of several royal styles for the monarch empowered by the ritsuryô codes. The title seems to have come into use in the late seventh century—wooden documents on which it is used have been excavated and are thought to date from the 670s, from either the reign of Temmu (673-86) or shortly after.
