        "[Large] painted screens of [Kyoto's] cityscape--with its palaces, Buddhist temples, and Shinto shrines--that were made for daimyo to carry off to their castles in locales far from the capital.  Also depicted in the screens were places of scenic beauty around the city, popular for excursions and picnics and dance performance under flowering cherry trees or autumn maples.  The screens provided a continuous narrative of the pleasures of the capital that the viewer could tour vicariously.  The panoramic design and the conventions used in [these screens] were already fully evolved in the Machida pair of the 1520s, the earliest of these works to survive.  A magnificent pair by Kanō Eitoku was sent by Nobunaga as a gift to Uesugi Kenshin in 1573; the names of 223 of the buildings and scenic places that appear on the screens are identified by inscriptions (p. 733). [狩野永徳、織田信長、上杉謙信]"
