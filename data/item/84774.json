        "A system of official distribution of rice paddies based on registration of the populace and productive rice land. It was mandated by the ritsuryō codes based on Chinese precedents. Every resident of the realm above the age of six was to receive a personal allotment of paddy land (kubunden 口分田) to cultivate during his or her lifetime; distribution was accomplished through residential units, or ko. In return for the fields, male subjects owed tribute to the tennō's government. Redistribution of new fields-or the confiscated fields of deceased countrymen-was to occur every six year under the authority of the provincial governor, save in the kinai, where a special agent, the handenzukai, presided.　[律令、戸、天皇、畿内、班田使(はんでんし）］"
