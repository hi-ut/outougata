        "(alt., hi) the queen-consort at the Yamato court, a position that was probably instituted in the fifth century. Established by the later sixth century was the office of senior queen-consort, ōkisaki 大后. The new office was part of a strategy to stabilize royal succession by ranking royal consorts. According to the ritsuryō Law on Personnel for the Rear Palace (Kōkyū shikiin-ryō), there could be nine royal consorts of three different statuses: two kisaki 妃, three bunin 夫人, and four hin 嬪. A kisaki was to be a woman of royal blood with the rank of princess; a bunin was to be a woman of the third rank; and a hin was to be of the fifth rank. In addition, the mother of the crown prince was honored with special treatment as the kōtaigō 皇太后, while the grandmother of the tennō was styled taikōtaigō 太皇太后.↓[律令、後宮職員令]"
