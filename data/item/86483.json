        "Heading the maidservant hierarchy, chambermaids were most intimately associated with their employers.  Among other things, they attended to the master's bedding...they were better equipped to lift the quilts into the closets each morning.  They also appeared more dignified accompnaying a palanquin (p. 51)."
