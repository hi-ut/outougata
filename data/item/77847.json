        "(706-764) Having gained power as a politician with the support of Empress Kōmyō and regnant Empress Kōken, he was given the name Emi no Oshikatsu and made prime minister under Emperor Junnin. However, in opposition to Kōken's (then Shōtoku) increasing reliance on the priest Dōkyō, he instigated the Rebellion of Emi no Oshikatsu in 764. The rebellion was put down and Nakamaro was killed in Omi Province soon after. [光明皇后、孝謙天皇、淳仁天皇、称徳天皇、道鏡、恵美押勝、近江国]"
