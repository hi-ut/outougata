        "A coming-of-age rite for boys of good family, usually performed when the child was between the ages of ten and fifteen. It marked the assumption of a man's name, hairstyle, and clothing. As the name indicates, the central element in the ceremony was the assumption of a man's cap (kammuri). For an emperor, there were three main officiants. First, an assistant hairdresser (nōkan, sōkaku) placed a temporary Chinese-style hat, made of figured gauze, on the youth's head, loosened and combed out the loops of his boyish coiffure, bound the hair with a fillet, and trimmed the ends. Next, a hairdresser (rihatsu) removed the Chinese headgear. Then a capper (kakan, hikiire) emplaced the cap of manhood, and the hairdresser combed the hair. In the case of a less exalted initiate, there were only two officiants, with the hairdresser performing the assistant hairdresser's functions as well as his own. It was usual for the chancellor, the minister of the left, and the head of the palace storehouse bureau to act as capper, hairdresser, and assistant hairdresser, respectively, at an emperor's capping ceremony.
