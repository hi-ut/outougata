        "(r. 1716-45)  The eighth shogun was selected from the Kii branch of the Tokugawa house.  Having served as a daimyo for some ten years, he came to the office of the shogunate iwth a reputation as a strong administrator.  Upon his transfer to Edo Castle he undertook the first major revision\" of the bakufu system:  the so-called Kyōhō Reforms.  Proclaimed as a \"return to Ieyasu's legacy,\" it sought to expand the bakufu's finances, clean up corruption in the land-tax system, and improve morale among lesser vassals of the shogun by bettering their financial status (p. 21).
