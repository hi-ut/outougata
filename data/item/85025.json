        "Light verse of the Edo period.Derived from linked verse (renga) of the medieval era, it became popular because it was free of most of the rigid stylistic and topical conventions that had governed linked verse. One offshoot of haikai was the 5-7-5 syllable satiric verse known as senryu. In their form, if not their content, senryu look like the more serious haiku.［連歌, 川柳］"
