        "[A book by Yamaga Sokō] which dealt with the period of military rule from thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries. [It] covered various topics like methods of warfare, weapons, and the construction of castles.  In essence it was a kind of encyclopedia--a heigaku textbook--inteded to give the bushi, whose function was to fight, systematic knowledge of the matters necessary for the performance of that function (p. 422).
