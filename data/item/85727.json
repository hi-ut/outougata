        "The principle of original enlightenment. According to Tendai and Shingon Buddhist teachings, the seeds of enlightenment exist within each mind, and thus it is possible for one to be enlightened within the phenomenal world. According to LaFleur, hongaku rejected the dualism of body and mind, or of physical and nonphysical entities (1983:21)."
