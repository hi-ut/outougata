        "Literally bow and arrow,\" but refers to the warrior social order. Tozama used such language to describe themselves in the fourteenth century. References exist for phrases such as the \"house of the bow in arrow\" (yumiya no ie); the \"way of the bow and arrow\" (yumiya no michi); and the \"honor of the bow and arrow\" (yumiya no menboku).
