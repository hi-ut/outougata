        "The tate kugo, or vertically held harp, such as the two in the Shōsō-in, originated in Assyria and traveled to Japan via China and Paekche. Strings are stretched between stave next to a curved sounding box that rises vertically and an arm that extends horizontally. Tuning cords hang down from the rod and a leg extends downwards from the sounding box. [竪箜篌、正倉院]"
