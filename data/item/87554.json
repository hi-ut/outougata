        "Private estates that began to be created in the eighth century through the privatization of public land. At its zenith, the twelfth century, this landholding system became the most important political and economic institution. These estates were created through land reclamation, lands received by religious institutions as gifts from the emperor or the highest officials of the civil government, and, most frequently, commendation of land to the highest-ranked nobles who could exempt them from taxation and prevent entry by civil officials. The means of establishing these estates changed over time, and as a result, those who shared income from these estates also changed and became increasingly complex. These estates were gradually transformed into fiefs controlled by the warrior class in the Kamakura period and had totally disappeared by the late sixteenth century.
