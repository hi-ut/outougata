        "Also known as nobuseri, this word refers to skirmishers of all social rank, and not as a class\" of foot soldiers as been sometimes assumed. These skirmishers were generally archers, and were indicative of the nature of fighting during the fourteenth century, when loosely scattered groups of soldiers predominated.\""
