        "the great gate (alt., Nandaimon 南大門 great south gate). By the time the Oharida palace was built for Great King Suiko at the turn of the seventh century, a great south gate served as the main entrance to the palace precincts. Yamato builders closely followed prescriptions for palace construction contained in such Chinese ritual texts as the Chou li, or Rites of Chou. [小墾田宮、推古]"
