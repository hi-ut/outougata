        "Also read jinin.  Persons under the protection of powerful Shinto shrines who were obligated to provide various services in exchange for this protection. (Yamamura Kozo, The Cambridge History of Japan, Volume 3: Medieval Japan). Also, low-ranking functionaries of various shrines, originally responsible for helping with religious ceremonies and shrine management. However, with the flourishing of shrine shōen, the number of jinnin increased and their responsibilities expanded to include new roles such as management of shōen, shrine financial interests and security at shrines and ceremonies (Suzanne Gay, The Moneylenders of Medieval Kyoto, 68-9)."
