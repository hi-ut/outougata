        "Minamoto no Toshifusa's (1035-1121) diary. One of the more extensive diaries for Shirakawa's early years, covering the years from 1062 to 1108, though there are several missing entries. Toshifusa reached the rank of sadaijin (Minister of the Left) before he retired from politics just before his death in 1121."
