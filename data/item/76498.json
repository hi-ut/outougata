        "The konrō [軒廊] can refer to an outdoor corridor with an earthen floor. In the case of the Covered-gallery Divination, the specific corridor is usually considered to be that connecting the eastern side of the southern aisle with the eaves  of the Shishinden to the Giyōden.  The object of the ritual was often to define means of changing severe weather such as droughts, floods, and typhoons.  [軒廊、紫宸殿、宜陽殿]"
