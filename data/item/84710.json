        "Originating in the Temmu era, the Benkan initially aided the ministerial Daijōkan in overseeing the various ministries while linking throne, Daijōkan, and ministries. In the early decades of the eighth century, as the processes by which ritsuryō governance worked were articulated, the Benkan came to function as an agency providing staff support to the Daijōkan and mediating between that body, ministries, and provinces.　[天武、太政官、律令]"
