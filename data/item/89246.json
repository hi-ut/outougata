        "The highest Minister of State.  The office of Daijō Daijin was supposed to remain vacant unless a man could be found whose outstanding character and moral probity qualified him to serve as a model for the Emperor, as well as for members of the bureaucracy; and the appointee was to restrict himself to the role of exemplar, keeping free of the mundane business of conducting ceremonies, supervising appointments, and the like.   Within the Code hierarchy, the title Daijō Daijin conferred not only unparalleled prestige, but also such unique privileges as an official posthumous name symbolic of the late minister's Confucian virtues.  We have attempted to convey its special distinction through the translation Chancellor (p. 797)."
