        "Fukūjōju (Butsu) (J.) 不空成就（佛）, also called 阿目伽悉地 Abokyashitsuji. This figure (Sk. Amoghasiddhi) is the Buddha of the north among the 5 Buddhas in the Diamond Realm mandala, representing among them the wisdom to accomplish whatever must be done to benefit beings. In the Womb Realm, he is also understood to be identical with the northern Buddha 天鼓雷音 Tenkuraion (Sk. Divyadundubhimeghanirghoşa) and with the historical Buddha."
