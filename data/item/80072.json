        "Fujiwara no Yorinaga (J.) 藤原頼長, commonly known as 宇治左大臣, 悪左府 Uji sadaijin, Aku safu. This son of the powerful Tadazane (1078-1162) rose to the position of minister of the left, and was known for his scholarship. However, loved excessively by his father, he managed to gain the leadership of the Fujiwaras from his elder brother Tadamichi (1097-1164), but later lost the support of retired emperor Toba and died of wounds suffered in the Hōgen war (1156), aged 36."
