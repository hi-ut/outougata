        "Hōjō Masako (J.) 北条政子, sometimes called 尼将軍 Ama shōgun. Wife of Minamoto no Yoritomo, this daughter of Hōjō Tokimasa (1138-1215) ruled the Kamakura bakufu together with her father and brother Yoshitoki (1163-1224) after the death of Yoritomo in 1199. After the assassination of her son Minamoto no Sanetomo (1192-1219), she ruled together with Yoshitoki on behalf of the child shōgun Kujō Yoritsune (1218-56), and prevented dissension among her vassals on the occasion of the Jōky・conflict (1221), helping ensure the continuation of the bakufu system and the dominance of the Hōjō clan before her death in 1225 at the age of 68."
