        "Two organs of the Kamakura bakufu, the Rokuhara tandai and the Chinzei tandai. The former was created in the aftermath of the 1221 Jōkyū war, and served to guard the capital, and to provide an arena for the preliminary adjudication of court cases, particularly those arising in western Japan. In the aftermath of the 1281 Mongol Invasion, a similar office was established in Kyūshū (the Chinzei). Both were annihilated with the fall of Kamakura in 1333. [承久の乱、鎮西]"
