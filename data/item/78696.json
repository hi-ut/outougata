        "The deputy to a provincial Governor.  In the case of Hitachi, Kazusa, and Shimōsa, the titular Governor was a Prince, but since the post was a sinecure, only the Deputy Governor actually went to the province.  (The Governor of Hitachi who figures in “Yadorigi” and succeeding chapters is actually such a Deputy.)  The rank of a Deputy Governor, like that of a Governor, depended on the standing of his province, but it was in the sixth rank range.[常陸、上総、下総、宿木][RK]"
