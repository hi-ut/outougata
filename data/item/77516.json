        "One family, or an autonomous house, capable of acting with autonomy. Headed by a chieftain, or sōryō, all the members of an ichizoku consisted of dependent relatives (kenin, or housemen). Both direct descendants, hereditary retainers, and relatives lacking autonomy could be subsumed into an ichizoku. By contrast, autonomous tozama relatives could only be incorporated into a voluntary ichimon grouping. [惣領、家人、一門]"
