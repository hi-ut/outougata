        "Minor functionaries in the Minsitry of Central Affairs, chosen during the Nara period from among junior members of leading families, but later drawn from among men in the service of the great houses.  According to the Yōrō Code, which fixed their number at ninety (a figure that fluctuated during the Heian period), their functions were to stand night duty at Court, perform miscellaneous tasks, and escort the Imperial litter.  By mid-Heian, it was usual for some of them to act as regental Escorts."
