        "Guardian was a nonofficial position, which, the author implies, Michinaga held as the senior maternal relative.  Since a new nairan decree had been issued to him on the Twenty-third of the Eighth Month, 1011, he was, in fact, the official surrogate of the Emperor, even though he had refused the title of Regent (Kanpaku) (p. 316). [藤原道長、内覧、関白]"
