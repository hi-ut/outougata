        "Fifty-five volume work written by Kajiwara Shōzen (1266-1337) between 1302 and 1304 in order to help physicians with diagnoses; in it he eschewed the learned and difficult-to-comprehend Chinese style of traditional writings in favor of a kana-rich Japanese so that the work could be widely understood (p. 81). [梶原性全] [HW]"
