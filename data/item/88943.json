        "The official chronicle of the Kamakura Bakufu for the years 1180-1266. Though many details are offered for the early years of the bakufu, this source has the typical weaknesses of an official history, as it attempts to legitimize the Hojo family's control of the shogunate. It is probably most reliable for its historical contents for the later years."
