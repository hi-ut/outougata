        "Together with Ono, one of 2 major branches of the Shingon school, the Hirosawa branch includes a number of lineages. Although the branch traces its roots to 益信 Yakushin (827-906), the name derives from the area where 寛朝 Kanchō (916-998), grandson of emperor Uda, founded the temple 遍照寺 Henjōji in 989 through the patronage of emperor Kazan. Strictly speaking, the term Hirosawa branch includes the following 3 lineages: 華蔵院流 Kezō'in-ryū founded by prince-monk 聖恵 Shōkei (1094-1137), 忍辱山流 Ninnikusen-ryū founded by 寛遍 Kanpen (1100-1166), and 伝法院流 Denbō'in-ryū founded by 覚鑁 Kakuban (1095-1143). More generally, however, when it is contrasted with the Ono branch, 3 other lineages (the so-called 仁和寺三流 Ninnaji san-ryū which derive from the Hirosawa line are included: Hoju'in-ryū founded by Yōgen (1075-1151), 仁和寺御流 Ninnaji-goryū founded by the prince-monk Kakuhō hōshinnō (1091-1153), and 西院流 Nishi-no-in-ryū founded by 信証 Shinshō (1088-1142)."
