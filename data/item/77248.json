        "In this exhibition, this term refers to figured gauze-weave silk. Warps are displaced over one another in a complicated arrangement of crossings that create patterns such as diagonal lattice and lozenges. The crossed warps are held in place by the wefts. These crossings can have two basic constructions, net (ami mojiri) or basket (kagome mojiri). The interlace structure of ra is more complex than that of sha, a simple gauze structure where pairs of adjacent warps interlock. The latter is uncommon in the Shōsō-in. [網綟、籠目綟（籠綟）、正倉院]"
