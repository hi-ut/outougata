        "Annual land payment to the overlord class: dues, tax tribute,impost. Collected on the basis of land area, it was generally paid in rice but, depending location, also in other agricultural or marine products; commuted in part to cash in the late Kamakura period. In the medieval period, nengu tended to absorb other taxes on land and on individual cultivators."
