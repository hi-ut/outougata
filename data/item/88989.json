        "The diary of Minamoto no Tsunenobu (1016-1097), who was a successful courtier of the upper-middle nobility. He reached the rank of dainagon (Senior Counselor) before his appointment in 1094 to the Heian court's office in Kyushu, where he later died. A large part of the diary has been lost, leaving only entries for some four years during Shirakawa's era."
