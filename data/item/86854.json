        "[P]opular publications written mostly in simple language for easy reading, which appeared in large numbers from the middle of the [17th] century.  Using far more kana than Chinese characters, they are known as kana zōshi, and they were made up in several slim volumes or fascicles of twenty to thirty leaves each.  They were intended to be entertaining reading--romances, miscellanies of unusual tales, stories of the supernatural, humorous anecdotes--but too often the story form was really a device to make the didactic message palatable (pp. 727-728)."
