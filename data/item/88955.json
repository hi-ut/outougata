        "Sanjo Sanefusa's diary covers the years from 1166 to 1195, although several segments are missing today. Sanefusa was a mid -to high-ranking courtier about whom not much is known, though he did reach the rank of Minister of the Left and Minister of the Right before retiring in 1196. Another valuable source for the eventful decades at the end of the twelfth century, the Gumaiki has unfortunately not been printed in one comprehensive series, since the remaining copies of the diary are kept at different locations."
