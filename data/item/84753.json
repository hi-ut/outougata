        "An anthropological construct describing a system of organizational integration by which kin groups achieve a degree of intergenerational unity even as they fission. Such integration is based primarily on giving reverence to a common ancestor. Individual status within the kin group depends on seniority based on age and sex as well as on one's position vis-à-vis the clan founder's lineage. Scholars view the kin organization of Yayoi and Kofun times as one in which conical-type clans played an important role."
