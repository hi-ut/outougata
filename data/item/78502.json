        "An imperial daughter appointed to this title by her father, or the recognized grand daughter of an Emperor in the male line.  Suetsumuhana, whose father was a Prince, is therefore a Princess.  In contrast Aoi, whose mother is a Princess, is not one herself; the narration treats her purely as a commoner.  Ukifune, the daughter of a Prince, is not a Princess because her father did not recognize her.[末摘花、葵、浮舟][RK]"
