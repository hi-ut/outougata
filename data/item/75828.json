        "A formal decree that records the tennō’s will.  It is written out in a particular format to be disseminated to the lower echelons. Originally, in order to issue the document, a female functionary of the bach palace would convey the order to the Ministry of Central Affairs where it would undergo a complex, multi-step process before distribution. After the Royal Secretariat was established, one of the members of that office fulfilled the function of conveying the order. Depending on the contents of the order, it would be distributed through the Bureau of Secretaries of the Ministry of Affairs, the Board of Controllers, or the Secretariat of the Department of Court Affairs. The document prepared by the former two offices in order to disseminate the tennō’s orders is called a royal decree (senji). [天皇、宣旨]"
