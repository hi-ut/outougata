        "Military estate stewards (jitō) newly appointed by the Kamakura bakufu following the Jōkyū war of 1221 to lands confiscated from the defeated army of the imperial court. Most of the new jitō were located in central and western Japan, over which the bakufu now enlarged its influence. From this point forward the post of jitō became a truly national institution.　[承久の乱]"
