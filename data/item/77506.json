        "A type of armor fastened in the back, this lightened, simplified armor first appeared early in the fourteenth century. As high-ranking warriors began wearing dōmaru, which was more suitable for fighting on foot than their larger suits of armor (yoroi), haramaki arose as a lighter alternative. In contrast to dōmaru, which were gastened on the side, with one plate attached to the top of the other, haramaki were merely fastened together at the back. This meant that they were far weaker than dōmaru and yoroi, and thus used almost exclusively by lower-ranking warriors. In most cases, sode and helmets were not worn with haramaki. [胴丸、鎧]"
