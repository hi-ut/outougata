        "A unit of value for gold and silver coins; the standard gold coin issued by the shogunate, the koban, was equivalent to one ryō in the early seventeenth century and contained almost exactly fifteen grams of gold, although it was periodically devalued thereafter; the shogunate fixed the exchange rate of one ryō of gold at fifty(later sixty)monme of silver or four kan(kanmon)of copper coins; one silver ryō generally was equivalent to four or five monme of that metal.
