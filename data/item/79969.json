        "Amida (Butsu, Nyorai) (阿弥陀佛、如来), also referred to as Muryōju (無量寿), Muryōkō (無量光), Amidaba (阿弥陀婆), Kanjizai-ō Butsu (観自在王佛), Kanro Nyorai (甘露王如来); known as having been, prior to Buddhahood, Hōzō bosatsu (法蔵菩薩). Buddha of the Pure Land to the west called 極楽浄土 (J. Gokuraku jōdo; Sk. Sukhāvatī).  A non-historical Buddha, Amida as a bodhisattva vowed that all those who contemplate on him (念仏 Ch. nien-fo, J. nenbutsu, alternatively meaning to recite his name) would be born after death in his Pure Land. Aristocrats, clerics, and perhaps the lower classes of late Heian and Kamakura Japan commonly believed that recitation of the name would lead to birth in the Pure Land in spite of the onset of the Last Age of Buddhism, mappō."
