        "literally, the vows platform\" at Tōdaiji, built for use by the Chinese monk Ganjin in the 750s. After it was constructed, all Buddhist monks were to take their vows there once they had completed requisite preparation and certification procedures. Later, however, the court ordered that provincial monks remain in their own provinces to take vows. But late　eighth-century monks like Saichō (767-822) still came from the provinces to the Kaidan'in to study and take vows. [東大寺、鑑真、最澄]\""
