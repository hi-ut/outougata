        "This non-historical Buddha (Skt. Akṣobhya) occupies a land to the East where he preaches the dharma, and is one of the 5 main Buddhas of the Diamond Realm Mandala, especially symbolizing the perfect mirror-like wisdom of Dainichi.  Given that his land lies to the East, he has often been associated with Yakushi Nyorai in historical Japan."
