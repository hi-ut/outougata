        "Kukai's Hand-Imprinted Legend,\"according to which Koyasan claimed that a substantial area close to the mountain was granted to the founder. The legend was created in the mid-Heian period, as the Kongobuji clergy attempted to expand the temple's influence in Kii Province. Though clearly a fabrication, the claim was eventually acknowledged in the early fourteenth century, as local rulership began to spread and the imperial family sought the support of powerful Buddhist institutions such as Koyasan.\""
