        "Historical period beginning in 710, the year the capital was moved from ↓Fujiwarakyō to Heijōkyō (in Nara), and ending in 784, when the capital was moved to Nagaokakyō. The ten years between 784 and the beginning of the Heian period in 794 are generally included in the Nara period. It is noted as the period when the ritsuryō system of government, which adapted the laws, codes, land policies, and bureaucratic forms of T'ang China, reached its height and other aspects of Chinese civilization were actively introduced.　[藤原京、平城京、長岡京]"
