        "The original name for discussions by senior nobles held in the guard-post of the Left Palace Bodyguards.  The guardpost was located under the western eaves, in the southern room of the Giyōden. The same discussions were also later known as 仗座 (jōza).  The jōza were held at the southern side of the Shishinden, in the northern corridor of the eastern face. [宜陽殿、紫宸殿]"
