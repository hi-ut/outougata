        "The designation of historians for the system of divided inheritance of family property that prevailed during the thirteenth century. Other scholars use this term to connote a pattern of warrior organization in which, despite divided inheritance, general leadership over an extended family was retained by a single person. The term sōryō-family head-appears in numerous documents after the 1220's."
