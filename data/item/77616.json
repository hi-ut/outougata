        "Although the Japanese term ganryō is used to refer to pigments in general, more strictly speaking it refers to organic and inorganic coloring agents that dissolve in neither water nor oil. Typical examples are white lead (gofun) and red lead (tan), both of which must be mixed with animal glue in order to adhere to a surface. [胡粉、丹]"
