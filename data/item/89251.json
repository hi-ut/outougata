        "Great Tree, a kinnara King, who lived with countless other kinnaras (horse-headed musicians in Indra's service) on Incense Mountain (Kōsen) north of the Himalayas.  (The mountain is identified with Mount Kailāsa in Tibet, just north of the Nepalese border.)  The myriad worlds shook when he played his beryl zither before the Buddha, and agreat assemblage of disciple rose and danced like children (p. 557). [HW]"
