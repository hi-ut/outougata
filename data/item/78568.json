        "Refers to a Minister or a Chancellor.  The use of “the Minister” rather than “His Excellency” implies a greater distance between that figure and the narrator (or the side with which her sympathies and those of her audience lie).  An example is the Minister of the Right, as distinguished from His Excellency (of the Left) in the chapters leading up to Genji’s exile.[源氏][RK]"
