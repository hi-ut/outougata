        "Chinese damask is thought to have been the name given by the Japanese to a particular type of imported silk developed in China at the beginning of the Sung period (960-1279).  It was a warp-faced twill with patterning in weft-faced twill, and with the diagonal lines of the ground and pattern running in opposite directions.  The twill floats in both the ground and the pattern extended over five threads, producing a satiny effect.  The cloth was woven in grege and beaten to make it soft and lustrous (p. 221n).\""
