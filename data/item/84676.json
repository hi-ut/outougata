        "An observance of Chinese origin, held on the seventh night of the seventh month, both at court and in private residences, to mark the annual reunion of the Weaver Maid (the star Vega) and her spouse, the Ox-Driver (the star Altair), who were separated by the River of Heaven (Milky Way) during the rest of the year. The Ox-Driver was believed to row across the river, or according to another version of the legend, to cross on a bridge made of magpie wings. Offerings of fruit, incense, calligraphy, music, and poetry were presented, and women prayed for skill in sewing, one of the Weaver Maid's accomplishments."
