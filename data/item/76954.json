        "a provincial monks’ temple, construction of which was mandated in every province during the reign of Shômu Tennô (r. 724-49). Remains of both monks’ temples and provincial nunneries (kokubunniji  国分尼寺) have been found in many of the 66 provinces. Some of these establishments continued operating into mid-Heian times."
