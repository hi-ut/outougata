        "Ashikaga Takauji (足利尊氏), originally written 高氏, and known posthumously in Kamakura as Chōju'in (長寿院).  The first shōgun of the Ashikaga bakufu, Takauji established the northern dynasty of emperors.  Although he and his younger brother Tadayoshi worked as a team controlling military and legal affairs respectively, they had a falling out in the late 1340s which led eventually to the assassination of Tadayoshi in 1352.  However, Takauji continued to wage war on the supporters of Tadayoshi, and was planning to overtake Tadayoshi's foster son Tadafuyu (actually Takauji's own child) in Kyushu in 1358 when he fell ill and died."
