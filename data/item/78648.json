        "The official history of China from the beginning up to the reign of Emperor Wu of the Early Han Dynasty, completed by Sima Quian (J. Shiba Sen) in 91 BC.  It covers up to the Early Han dynasty and is the model for all later dynastic histories.  A basic text at the Academy (together with the Hanshu), and essential reading for Heian officials, it left traces in the tale itself.[司馬遷、平安][RK]"
