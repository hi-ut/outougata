        "A second-level appeal of a lawsuit verdict. When a Kamakura shugo or the Bakufu's branch headquarters at Rokuhara settled a dispute, verdicts were commonly appealed to Kamakura. But osso could also be heard by Rokuhara itself, or by Kamakura in cases it had originally adjudicated.　［守護、六波羅］"
