        "This long wraparound skirt was worn by women in the Nara period. Vertical stripes, often formed by sewing strips of different fabric together, were common. The slightly flared skirt was then secured into a sash-like waist band. By the Heian period this skirt had evolved into a decorative train worn in the back over fulllength robes."
