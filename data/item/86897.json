        "As expressed by [Aizawa] Seishisai, the moral values of trust, loyalty, filial piety, peace, and well-being among the people--in short, those values that society agreed to be essential for orderly life--all are part of that national essence that was transferred as a mandate from Heaven to the divine line of archaic kings through the sun goddess Amaterasu.  Moral values were thus inherent to the Japanese sacred community and were not imported from the Asian continent at a later time (p.640). [ 会沢正志斎、天照大神]"
