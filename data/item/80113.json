        "This sovereign reigned only 3 years (1155-58), but he went on to exercise great political power for 34 years as retired emperor. He outlived his enemies the Tairas and engaged in continuing political machinations to preserve the power of the imperial in the wake of the dawn of the Kamakura bakufu. Also, having taken the tonsure in 1169, he actively supported Buddhist construction activities and often went on pilgrimage. Go-Shirakawa also studied arts such as imayō melodic singing and compiled the collection 梁塵秘抄 Ryōjin hishō before dying in 1192 at the age of 65."
