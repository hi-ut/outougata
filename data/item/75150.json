        "Grey recycled paper the imperial court took to using. Because paper proved intrinsically valuable, the imperial court took to recycling documents, dissolving old papers and making documents anew which took on a charcoal color because of the ink residue. These documents, called shukushi, were issued only by chamberlains for emperors or retired emperors."
