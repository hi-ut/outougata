        "Genkaku (J.) 賢覚, also called 理性 Rishō. Founder of the Rishō lineage of the Ono branch of Shingon at Daigoji, Genkaku received denbō kanjō from the Daigoji monk 頼照 Raishō (fl. early 12th c.), and later received it again from the founder of Daigoji Sanbō'in, the influential monk Shōkaku, in 1108. Not long after, he established Rishō'in at Daigoji, and among his disciples was the powerful monk Kakuban."
