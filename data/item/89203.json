        "[Also butsumyō-e (仏名会）] The purpose of the Buddhist Names Services, held annually during this period on the nights of the Nineteenth, Twentieth, and Twenty-first of the Twelfth Month, was to expunge sins accumulated during the year. The Jijūden picture of Kannon was transferred to the curtain-dais of the Seiryōden, and the Daytime Room was decorated with Buddhist images, pagodas, flowers, and censers.  Seven screens were set up in the adjoining eavechambers, each covered with horrifying pictures of sinners undergoing torments in the hot, cold, and other hells described in the Buddhist literature.  The services, attended by members of the Court, consisted primarily of the recitation (by monks and others) of the names of 3,000 buddhas, a practice recommended in the Sanzenbutsumyō Sutra as a means of expiating sin (p. 148n).
