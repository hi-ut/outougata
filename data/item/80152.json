        "Hōjō Sanetoki (J.) 北条実時, also called 金沢実時、称名寺殿、金沢侍所 Kanezawa Sanetoki, Shōmyōjidono, Kanezawa samuraidokoro. Known originally for his talents in martial arts, Sanetoki was a close vassal of the shōgun and rose within the bakufu to positions such as overseer of Echigo province, but fell ill in 1275 at the age of 51, and retired to his residence in Kanezawa, Musashi province (present-day Yokohama), dying the next year. Sanetoki is best known for his efforts in scholarship and active collecting of a variety of manuscripts; in 1258 he had an Amida hall constructed at his residence, later renaming it Shōmyōji temple, and installed his collection of manuscripts on the temple grounds--the beginning of what later came to be called Kanazawa Bunko."
