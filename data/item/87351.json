        "Also pronounced Taibon Sankajō. Formalized in the Goseibai Shikimoku code of 1232, this phrase referred to the authority of the military governors (shugo) under the Kamakura bakufu. Despite the phrase, shugo authority under this regulation\" included jurisdiction over the crimes of murder and rebellion and the obligation of mustering the imperial guard. The term continued to be used into the Muromachi period.　[御成敗式目、守護、鎌倉幕府]　\""
