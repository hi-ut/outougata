        "These temporary or provisional posts were granted to men to whom the government wished to give official posts and accompanying salaries, but could not do so because there were no vacancies. Consequently, these men were appointed Provisional such-and such, thereby acquiring posts and salaries. Their official duties and powers were generally negligible, except among the Buddhist officials, but this again depended on the man in question and the caliber of the real officials. All the provisional posts mentioned in this book are to be found listed on either side of this since they all start with Gon\".\""
