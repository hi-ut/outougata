        "An unusual source in which many documents issued by the daijokan (the Council of State) were recorded in chronological order by various scribes (geki), who were responsible for recording precedents and edicts issued. The collection is far from complete, covering a broad span from 790 to 1186, and little is known about its author(s) and origins, but there are some valuable entries in this collection for the Heian era."
