        "an extracodal royal inspector charged with superintending provincial administration in eastern provinces. The office is thought to have been based on a T'ang precedent, and its holder was higher in rank and possessed greater authority than the junsatsushi 巡察使, who were also itinerant inspectors. The earliest known appointment was made in 719, and appointments continued through 730. Azechi frequently were appointed to concurrent postings as provincial governors."
