        "A chronicle of Daisenji, written mostly in the form of a hagiography. Unfortunately, the original document, believed to date from the early Muromachi period (probably from 1398), was destroyed in a fire on 1925/4/22. The version that remains available today is compiled from shahon (copies of the original) from Tokyo University and Tokyo kokuritsu hakubutsukan. It contains several pictorial representations of the activities of the monks as Daisenji, which was a powerful monastic center outside the capital region."
