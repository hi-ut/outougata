        "mantra. Syllables, words or short phrases valued in esoteric (mikkyō, q. v.) practices for their inherent spiritual power rather than for their conceptual profundity. They are similar to, but usually shorter than, darani (q. v.). Mujū often refers to the Jiku no shu (Spell of Compassionate Help), the Kakai no ju (Fire World Spell), and tha Kōmyō shingon (Mantra of Light). The Shingon (Mantrayāna) is named for its emphasis on such mystic spells and related esoteric rites. [密教、陀羅尼、慈救呪、火界呪、光明真言]"
