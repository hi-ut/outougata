        "residential units (ko) assigned as prebends (fu) to support topranking officials, temples, shrines, and royal households such as those of the queen-consort and crown prince. Originally, fuko were to pay one-half of their land tribute (sō 租), and all of their other labor tribute (both chō 調 and yō 庸) to their designated master (fukoshu 封戸主). But later, fuko paid all tribute to the master."
