        "Meaning quite literally, [members of] the hundred surnames, this term initially designed all members of society who held an obigation to pay taxes, had a surname, and who had not attained the fifth court rank or above. With social stratification in the ninth through thirteenth centuries, the term hyakushō came to designate provincials who possessed surnames and were entrusted with shiki office, or who were holders of local public office. Once Minamoto Yoritomo created the gokenin order late in the twelfth century, most ambitious provincials became associated with this term, while others preferred the designation myōshu. The first reference to hyakushō as designating cultivators appears in the late thirteenth century, but even as late as the mid-fifteenth century, one still sees powerful provincials with surnames referring to themselves as haykushō. Although hyakushō of the thirteenth through fifteenth centuries could fight in battle, and even own horses, their allegiances were primarily lateral, to their compatriots, rather than directed toward a lord. [職、源頼朝、御家人、名主]"
