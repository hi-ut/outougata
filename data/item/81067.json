        "A controversy about nomenclature that erupted following Fujiwara no Mototsune's appointment as kampaku in 887.  In offering the post to Mototsune a second time after he had formally declined the first edict of appointment as required by custom, Emperor Uda--or, rather, Tachibana no Hiromi, the erudite of Chinese letters who drafted Uda's edict--equated kampaku with the Chiinese title a-heng (Japanese   akō), which in early China had designated the chief governmental minister.  Although the the same word had been used for Mototsune without incident in an imperial rescript three years earlier, this time Mototsune's steward, a Fujiwara named Sukeyo, also learned in Chinese, persuaded the Northern-House leader that akō actually referred to a purely nominal post without substantive duties and that the equation of the two titles implied the dismissal of Mototsune from government.  Mototsune thereupon refused to take further part in court affairs, bringing major governmental business to a halt, just as he had done during Yōzei's reign.  The controversy raged on for six or seven months, with one group of literati supporting Hiromi and another supporting Sukeyo, but finally the chastened Uda was forced to apologize and delete the offending word from his edict (p. 54).
