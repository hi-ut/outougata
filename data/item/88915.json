        "(1218-1256) The fourth son of Kujo Michiie, Yoritsune was sent to Kamakura at the age of one, following the assassination of the third shogun, Sanetomo, in an effort to create a bond between the warrior government and the imperial court. Yoritsune became the fourth shogun of the Kamakura Bakufu in 1226, though real control of the Kanto government rested with his Hojo regents. He was forced to resign in 1244 in favor of his young son, Yoritsugu, but returned to Kamakura the next year in an attempt to build his own following and overthrow the Hojo. Yoritsune was defeated by the young Hojo Tokiyori in 1246, after which he was sent back to Kyoto."
