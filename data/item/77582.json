        "Barriers, or toll gates, where tariffs were assessed, or supply routes blocked. Guarded by a small to medium number of troops, could be useful in blockades. In times of peace, their use as a means of controlling and taxing trade predominated. Go-Daigo attempted to abolish such barriers early in his reign, but the onset of civil war caused their numbers to increase. [後醍醐]"
