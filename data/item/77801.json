        "After the Onin war standardization of currency was desirable both for commercial stability and for the Bakufu's financial well-benig. This concern is reflected in a spate of shogunal laws specifying which types of currency were acceptable and in what combinations. Called money-choosing decrees\" (erizenirei), their purpose was to maintain a standard in the use of currency and thus ensure uniformity in financial transactions (pp. 161-3).\""
