        "A war tale that chronicles the conflicts in the capital region during the last years of the Heian age. Many scholars believed that the Genpei seisuiki, which consists of forty-eight scrolls, was compiled between 1247 and 1249, but, because of its literary style, there is now a general consensus that the work was written in the Nanbokucho era (1336-1392). Though believed to be based on the Heike monogatari, the Genpei seisuiki tells the tale of the Heike and the Genpei War in a slightly different manner. In particular, the detailed accounts of Enryakuji are intriguing, but they also reveal a critical view of the temple that is not uncommon in the war tales produced in the Kamakura era."
