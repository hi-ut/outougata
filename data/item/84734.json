        "the Bureau of the (Palace) University, established by the codes to educate future officials. Court support for scholarship was visible from Tenji's era onward. The school was overseen by the Shikibushō, or Ministry of Personnel, and was based on the T'ang system, although establishments in the Korean kingdoms, especially Paekche, also served as models. Semiannual ceremonies were held there to honor Confucius, and texts mandated for study by all students were those of the classical canon developed in China during Han times. [天智、式部省］"
