        "Commoners as well as samurai soon became involved in manufacturing paper as well as hairdress ties and umbrellas for sale outside the region. In addition, another related industry was eventually established, independently of political support, producing colorful paper cordage (mizuhiki) used for decorative and ceremonial purposes. Although the scale of production for decorative cordage and umbrellas would remain relatively small until the nineteenth century, the hairdress-tie and papermaking industries quickly becae major elements of the region's commercial economy. (pp. 87-88)   Deployed in Shintō rites the Heian period, mizuhiki were more commonly used in the Edo era for secular purposes, usually being tied into elabrate knots and affixed to gifts and ritual displays. Shinano Kyôikukai Shimoina Bukai 1934:128. (Footnote; p.87)"
