        "Guards and attendants at the court of the Yamato king, among whom served sons and brothers of local chieftains who professed loyalty to the king. The tradition continued in the ritsuryō era, with theえふ 衛府, or court guards that protected the throne; and with the toneri and ōtoneri, who served in the Bureau of the Left and Right Attendants. Toneri worked as attendants in the royal residence and at palaces of high-ranking ministers. By the eighth century the sons and grandsons of fourth and fifth rankers in the capital joined the sons of country chieftains and district chieftains in these units, diminishing the prestige of the latter. See also hyōe. [律令、兵衛]"
