        "Guard duty represented an obligation of all Kamakura-era gokenin, who were mobilized by the shugo of their province, and who served in the capital or Kamakura. Later on, warriors guarded Northern Kyūshū as well in the aftermath of the initial Mongol Invasion of 1274. Guard duty continued throughout the Nanbokuchō era, and the need to provide records of one's service contributed to the creation of the documentary form of chakutōjō. [御家人、守護、着倒状]"
