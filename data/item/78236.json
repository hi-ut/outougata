        "A “double dyed” (futaai) colour produced by dyeing cloth in safflower (the source of scarlet, kurenai) dye and then in indigo (ai).  The actual hue varied.  Brighter, deeper shades with little blue were worn by young men, while duller, paler tints with little red were worn by older men.[二藍、紅、藍][RK]"
