        "A contest held on the eighteenth of the first month by the archers of the Gate Watch and the Palace Guards.  (A month or two later, the privy gentleman held a similar one.)  A banquet (noriyumi no kaeri aruji) was given by the commander of the winning side.  By the author’s time this event seems to have lapsed.[賭弓の還饗][also 賭射][RK]"
