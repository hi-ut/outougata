        "The Jijuden was a sizable building directly north of the Shishinden.  In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the structure and its grounds were used chiefly for Buddhist services in honor of Kannon, for such annual observances as the Place Banquet and the wrestling matches, as well as for amusements like football and informal dancing.  Inspite of its proximity to the busy, well-guarded Seiryoden, it was considered an unsafe place to visit alone at night. [紫宸殿、観音、清涼殿]"
