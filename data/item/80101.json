        "Goma [ro] (J.) 護摩(炉), also referred to as 火炉、軍茶、君茶 karo, gunda, kunda. The hearth used in the fire rites of esoteric Buddhism. The shape and character of the hearth differs depending on the goal of the rite--prevention of calamity, acquisition of wealth, victory over enemies, the attainment of love, longevity and so on. In Shingon, a vessel (柄 e) within which to place the 蘇油 soyu oil mixture preprared for the fire is part of the hearth, an element lacking in the Tendai hearth."
