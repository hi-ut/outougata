        "the checkerboard\" grid system utilized for official land-opening projects initiated during the seventh and eighth centuries, first on royal estates and later by provincial and district officials. In the Nara period newly opened rice paddies were distributed to the populace as kubunden (individual cultivator's fields) in return for which tribute in various forms-sō, chō, and yō in the ritsuryō codes-was to be sent back to the royal treasury. The basic form that characterized such land-opening projects was an area divided into numerous squares, each aggregating 36 one-chō squares and equaling about 106 acres. One axis of the resulting grid was demarcated jō; the other axis was demarcated ri. Each chō was further subdivided into 36 numbered tsubo, which served as actual wet-rice cultivating units, or paddies, each about 0.08 acre in size. The location of each paddy in the grid was identifiable by the number of its jō, ri, and tsubo. Remains of jōri land-opening, ranging from eastern Japan to Kyūshū, can still be seen from the air.
