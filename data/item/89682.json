        "The Wardrobe (mikushigedono) was a Kōkyū establishment in which seamstresses tailored any part of the Imperial attire that was not supplied from other sources, such as the Palace Storehouse Bureau. Its mistress, the Mikushigedono no Betto, or simply Mikushigedono, was a personnage of imporance, who from around 970 on served as an Imperial concubine. Daughters of Kaneie and Michinaga, among others, advanced to the status of Junior Consort from that office [821]. In the eleventh century, it was merely a place where sewing was done [847].
