        "Sometimes called the Honsho.  This was generally some member of the Imperial Family or some High Court Noble (Kugyō) or the head priest of some powerful Buddhist temple or Shintō shrine with strong court connections. He protected the manors (shōen) at the Imperial Court from adverse legislation. He received annual tribute (nengu) from the Lord of Manors (Ryōshu) in return for winning exemptions from taxation on the lands and people of the manor.  [本所、公卿、荘園、年貢、領主]"
