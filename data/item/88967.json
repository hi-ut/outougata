        "(Fujiwara) Kadenokoji Kanenaka's diary, kept from 1274 to 1300, though several years in addition to shorter sections are missing. As a member of a minor Fujiwara branch, Kanenaka served in the mid-level ranks of the Kyoto bureaucracy. His diary is particularly rich in information on matters of litigation within the imperial court as well as on religious issues in the frightful times and aftermath of the Mongol invasions."
