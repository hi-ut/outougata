        "[A kind of baptism] in which a blindfolded believer tossed a flower toward a mandala spread in front of him.  The divinity on whose image the flower came to rest was identified as the believer's special guardian by the officiating monk, who proceeded to anoint the believer's head three times with kaji no kōsui, perfumed water over which rituals had been performed to give it protective powers (p. 511n). [加持の香水]"
