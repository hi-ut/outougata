        "On the death of an important personage, when that person's inferior relatives or close attendants immediately followed in death they were said to be performing junshi. In early times it appears to have taken the form of burial alive and to have been samewhat compulsory. Later it was voluntary suicide, and still later voluntary seeking of death in battle when one's feudal lord had been killed."
