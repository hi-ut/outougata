        "Fujiwara no Morosuke (J.) 藤原師輔, commonly known as 九条殿, 坊城右丞相 Kujō dono, Bōjō ujōshō. This powerful aristocrat, later seen as the founding ancestor of the Kujō lineage of the northern Fujiwaras, saw his fortunes realized with the accession of emperor Murakami (r. 946-67), who with Morosuke's daughter Anshi (927-64) as empress had two sons who became emperors. Although Morosuke died in 960, his sons Kanemichi (925-77) and Kane'ie (929-90) dominated the court in their era, and Kane'ie's son Michinaga (966-1027) gained a virtual lock on the imperial government during the first halfof the 11th c. Morosuke was also knowledgeable of ritual protocol, and wrote the ceremonial manual 九条年中行事 Kujō nenjū gyōji."
