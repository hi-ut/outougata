        "An eighth-century office, originally designed to quell barbarians, and hence known as Sei-i-taishōgun (征夷大将軍), this post became important as the highest authority within the bakufu, which contained delegated powers of military and judicial authority. Minamoto Yoritomo was appointed to this post in 1192, but he does not appear to have emphasized this office. After his death, and the rise of the Hōjō regents, this position increased in importance as the symbolic head of the Kamakura bakufu, even though the shōgun remained aloof from judicial matters and affairs of governance. During the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the post of shōgun was reserved for court nobles, or princes of imperial blood. With the downfall of the Kamakura bakufu in 1333, Ashikaga Takauji started laying claim to the post again, and was appointed shōgun in 1338 (in Ashikaga, or Muromachi bakufu). Nevertheless, he continued the princely tradition of remaining aloof from governance--save for enacting prayers and granting rewards--and delegated judicial and administrative powers to his brother Tadayoshi. Takauji's grandson Yoshimitsu resigned from the post of shōgun at a young age, and relied on more courtly authority. The last Ashikaga shōgun who attempted to directly rule was assassinated in 1441, and for the ensuing one hundred and thirty years, shōguns of the Ashikaga bakufu came to wield little administrative power.
