Two songs accompnaied the elevation of each object, the first sung by  the First Chorus (motokata) and the next by the Second Chorus (suekata).  The torimono section ended with a dance by the Director, after which there was an intermission, with wine and dramatic sketches (pp. 410-11). [神楽、榊、本方、末方]\""
