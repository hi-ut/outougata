        "[Handbook published in 1685] which listed events day by day under seven categories: Observances in the imperioal household, celebrations at Shinto shrines, official ceremonies, practices of the common people, memorial anniversaries, the showing of hidden treasures by temples and shrines, and Buddhist services.  Of the 3,100 events recorded in this work, over half are still observed in Kyoto today (p. 739)."
