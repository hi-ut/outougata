        "(1586-1641) Harunobu's son; Dom Miguel Arima.  [He was] one of the first ... who apostatized, was installed by the shogunate as daimyo in Arima, and immediately began a massive effort to force his Catholic subjects into abandoning their faith.  Not successful enough in that effort to please his masters, he was in 1614 transferred to another fief, Nobeoka in Hyūga.  He left behind him a restive Christian populace and the seedbed of the Shimabara Rebellion (p. 367).  [晴信、延岡、日向、島原の乱]"
