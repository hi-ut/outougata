        "In modern usage, the term sakaki ordinarily means the Cleyera japonica, a small tree related to the camellia, which is always to be found in the precincts of Shinto shrines.  In earlier times, it seems to have been used for any one of an indeterminate number of evergreens associated with the worship of the indigenous gods, including fragrant varieties such as the start anise, or shikimi (Illicium anisatum) (p. 240n).
