        "(Buddhist ceremony where) they would set up a so-called raiōzu 来迎図 (Painting of Amitāba's Welcoming\") at the deathbed of their fellow believers.　The painting depicted the Buddha Amida and one attached a five-coloured piece of string to the painting which the dying worshipper could keep in her or his hand.  The belief was that in this way Amida would lead one directly to the Western Paradise, an idea also known as raigō injō 来迎引接, or \"Amitāba's Welcoming and Taking One to His Paradise.\"  The Buddha in the painting was a direct manifestation of the real Buddha, and by clutching the painted Buddha's hand one was directly delivered to Amida.\""
