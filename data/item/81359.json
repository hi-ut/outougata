        "A 30-odd-acre stretch of water and woods that probably preserved something of the original landscape of the Kyoto basin.  There was a buildiing where the emperor and his courtiers gathered for banqueting, archery exhibitions, flower and autumn-leaf viewing, music, dance, and poetry composition.  Hunting and fishing also occasionally took place in the park.  During the course of the ninth century, the park was transformed from an imperial pleasure ground into a sacred place where holy men prayed for rain or for the cessation of rain, or sought to soothe the angry spirits that caused epidemic disease (pp. 118-119)."
