        "In addition to their official duties they mastered the Confucian classics. Because the post was given to skilled literati, starting in the middle of the Heian Period the position frequently went to the Nakahara and Kiyohara families, because they specialized in the Way of the Classics. (Heian jidaishi jiten).  From the middle of the Heian Period on, the function of the geki included handling various records and documents and reporting on precedents, compiling reports, and managing appointment ceremonies. (Geki bunin, p. 402) [中原、清原、外記補任]"
