        "The surname of the dominant non-imperial clan in the author’s time and for centuries on either side of it.  The author herself was a minor Fujiwara.  In the tale, the Minister of the Left (Genji’s father-in-law), hence Aoi and her brother Tō no Chūjôō, belong to this clan, and so do the Minister of the Right and his family, as well as many other figures.[藤原、源氏、葵、頭の中将][RK]"
