        "A sleeveless or short-sleeved man's vest used in the Imperial Court as part of the official court costume. The front sides overlap to form a V\" neck, and from the waist down it had a pleated skirt-like hem called a ran. It was worn under broad-sleeved robes like the hō. From the Nara period through the beginning of the Heian period, hanpi were frequently made of plain-weave silk, though some are damask twill (aya) and more elegant ones include fabrics with compound weave patterning (nishiki).
