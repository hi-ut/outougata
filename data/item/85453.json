        "The kagurasan was a common type of timber winch or rokuro.  Ropes looped about the legs of the winch and exiting right anchor it to trees to hold it in place.  The rope that drags, lifts, or lowers the timber being moved is wrapped two turns about the capstan to provide a frcition grip and held snug by a man standing offstage at right rear.  Four workmen move the log by turning the capstan, using the projecting arms (p. 59). [轆轤]"
