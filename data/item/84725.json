        "the assembly and working area for officialdom within the palace precincts. It has been called the garden of ministries.\" At Fujiwara and Nara it contained several halls (dō 堂) and was presided over by the Great Throne Hall, or Daigokuden. Behind it was the residential palace (Dairi). The chōdō served as ritual space where many of the most important activities of ritsuryō government took place, including the New Year's Audience (chōga), pronouncement of oral edicts (semmyō), and banquets for officials of the fifth rank and above.
