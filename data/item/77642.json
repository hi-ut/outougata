        "Much of the glass in the Shōsō-in-goblets, cups and beads-is imported. Although the majority of the pieces are made of leaded glass, either clear (haku ruri) or green (midori ruri), some of the dark blue ones, as well as the stemmed cup with air bubbles, are made of alkali-lime glass. Cups were often blown to create their shape, but small ornaments such as beads and ornamental fish were either made in a mold or ground into the desired forms. [白瑠璃、緑瑠璃]"
