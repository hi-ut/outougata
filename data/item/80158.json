        "Hoju'in-ryū (J.) 保寿院流, also called 平等房流 Byōdōbōryū Founded by 永厳 Yōgen (1075-1151), who had received denjō kanjō from the monk 寛助 Kanjo (1052-1125) of Ninnaji 成就院 Jōju'in, this line of the Hirosawa branch of Shingon bore an intimate connection with the Ninnaji 御流 Goryūline. Yōgen, based on a request from prince-monk Kakuhō, made the monk 覚成 Kakujō (also Kakuzei; 1126-98) one of his heirs in the Hoju'in line and gave to him the teachings and treasury of Hoju'in, which effectively became an imperial cloister (門跡 monzeki). Kakujō later made the prince-monk Shukaku the heir to this line. However, Yōgen also had other disciples who transmitted the teachings, making this line an influence on figures as disparate as 心覚 Shinkaku (1117-80) and 高辨 Kōben (also known as Myōe; 1173-1232)."
