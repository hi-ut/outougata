        "(rinne, samsāra) in the Realm of Desire (yokkai, kāmadhātu): (1) the heavens of desire (ten, deva); (2) the human world (ningen, manusya); (3) the world of fighting spirits (shura, asura); (4) the animal world (chikushō tiryagyoni); (5) the world of hungry-ghosts (gaki, preta); and (6) the hells (jigoku, naraka). We are reborn into the three Good Paths (sanzendō, or sanzenshu: 1-3) as the result of good actions (gō, q. v.) in previous lives; and into the Three Evil Paths (san'akudō) as retribution for bad action. But we regress even from the so-called good paths,\" and the proper goal for the religious life is release from all six, either to realize nirvāna (nehan) or birth (ōjō, q. v.) in, say, Amida's Pure Land of Supreme Bliss (gokuraku jōdo), from which there is no backsliding.
