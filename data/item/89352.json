        "By the mid-Heian period, the Punishments Ministry, charged by the Code with the administration of justice, the apprehension of criminals, and the operation of the capital's two prisons, had lost its functions to the Imperial Police.  Its Minister was usually a kugyō; the lower positions were hereditary in the Nahakara and Sakanoue families (p. 810).  [公卿、中原、坂上]"
