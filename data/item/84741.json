        "a liturgy of royal consecration that emerged in the 670s, performance of which was subsequently regularized by the ritsuryō Jingi-ryō. During the Daijōsai a new ruler personally offered first fruits from the harvest of the realm to the heavenly kami and shared a meal with the deities, while petitioning them for long life and prosperity in the realm.
