        "Rice fields used for the support of the Imperial Family, being similar in this respect to the old imperial rice fields (tonden ). Were tax free rice fields (fuyusoden ). Supervised by the Ministry of the Imperial Household, and by the Provincial Officials (Kokushi ). Rented to farmers who paid land rent (jishi) on them. This was then used to meet government expenses.
