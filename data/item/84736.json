        "the throne hall, where the monarch sat enthroned for various royal rituals. While the Nihon shoki mentions such a hall at the Itabuki palace in Great King Kōgyoku's day, archaeological evidence confirming its existence remains inconclusive. Scholars are also uncertain whether Temmu's Kiyomihara palace included such a structure, but the Fujiwara palace of the 690s certainly did. Use of the Daigokuden as a stage for royal ritual is clear in the historical record from Mommu's era onward.　[日本書紀、皇極、板蓋宮、天武、浄御原宮、藤原、文武]"
