        "A land steward under the jurisdiction of the warrior government. The office was used by Minamoto no Yoritomo, the founder of the Kamakura Bakufu, to control a large portion of the warrior class, although many jito were difficult to contain even for the warrior leaders. See in particular the works of Jeffrey Mass for extensive treatments of this important office."
