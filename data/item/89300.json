        "Fumihajime, performed when the son of a high-ranking family had reached the age of seven or eight.  Ostensibly intended to show the child how to read, it was a purely symbolic event, during which the elaborately robed young principal sat in silence while a Reader (Jidoku) intoned, and a Repeater (Shōfuku) repeated, a few words from a suitable text, usually the Classic of Filial Piety (Hsiao-ching) (p. 429). [侍読、尚復、孝経] [HW]"
