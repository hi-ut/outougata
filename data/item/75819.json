        "In the Nara and Heian periods those who traded, inherited, borrowed, lent, lost, or gained land or property might seek a seal from the provincial authorities. Usually the document [deed] upon which the seal was used had the expression “The provincial government recognizes that...” recorded in a blank space, or on an additional piece of paper. In addition, the name, rank, family name, personal name and monogram of all [four] members of the provincial gubernatorial staff were added, but from the middle of the Heian Period only the top provincial governor (kokushu) signed the document because he was usually the only person who actually went out to his assigned province.
