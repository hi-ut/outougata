        "[T]he belief, first expounded by certain Indian Buddhists, that the individual entered a brief intermediate existence (chūu) before being reborn.  On each seventh day until the forty-ninth, it was held, the soul had a chance at rebirth, and its fate could meanwhile be influenced by the acts of the living (p. 370). [HW]"
