        "The Tokugawa political system united some 260 formerly autonomous domains (han) into a federation overseen from Edo by the Tokugawa shoguns, a hereditary dynasty of suzerains . Although the Tokugawa directly ruled only a quarter of the national terrain, the officias who staffed their administration (the shogunate, or Bakufu) asserted broad powers to intervene in the affairs of the daimyo, fief holders who governed the remainder of the country. The daimyo retained fiscal autonomy, yet were regulated by the shogunate in such diverse matters as succession, marriage, trade, armaments, and foreign policy. (Footnote), [幕府, 大名]"
