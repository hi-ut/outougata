        "A generic name for local holders who were no longer cultivators but who also were not members of the official class. The lands exploited by a myōshu were registered under his name, and he was the basic element in local administration. An estate's fiscal and service obligations were apportioned by myōshu among their own tenants. Collection would then be made from the aggregate of myōshu."
