        "mandala. A symbolic representation of religious beings or attributes, usually portrayed in a geometrical pattern and used as a focus for meditation and ritual in esoteric (mikkyō q. v.) traditions. In Japan the term usually refers to two complementary paintings, representing knower and known, by whose integration the devotee realizes his identity with the Buddha Mahāvairocana (Dainichi Nyorai), thus attaining Buddhahood in this very body\" (sokushin jōbutsu). These two basic mandalas are the Diamond (kongōkai) and Matrix (taizōkai) Assemblies. See also mikkyō. Mujū also refers to several other paintings by this term: the Four-Enclosure (shijū) mandala (S&P 1:1), the Mandala Embracing All and Forsaking None (sesshu fusha mandara; S&P 1:10) and the Chikō mandara (the story of Chikō and Raikō is retold in Tsuma kagami).
