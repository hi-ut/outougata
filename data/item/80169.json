        "Honzon (J.) 本尊. The essentially venerated, that is, the primary object of worship in a given sacred space or ritual. The object can be venerated by or with other figures, and can take the form of an image, a wall-hanging of some sort, a lateral 3-imensional mandala, a verbalized or written phrase or name, an aniconic figure or visualized idea. In esoteric Buddhism, Dainichi is the most basic object of veneration, but insofar as the many Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and deities constitute aspects of Dainichi, they serve as honzon in particular rituals. In Pure Land Buddhism, the Buddha Amida alone or together with the attendants Kannon and Seishi is a basic honzon. However, in some cases-for example, the New Pure Land sect (Jōdo shinshū)--the name of Amida in its various forms and his light can be considered a honzon. In Nichiren Buddhism, the honzon takes forms such as that of ﾚākyamuni, of the light which shines forth from the great name (daimoku) of the Lotus Sūtra in the so-called mandala of the 10 realms (十界曼茶羅 jikkai mandara), the eternal Buddha Śākyamuni (久遠実成釈迦 Kuon jitsujō shaka) as taught in the Lotus, or simply the great name when chanted--南無妙法蓮華経 nam'myōhō rengekyō."
