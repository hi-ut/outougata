        "(alt., kokuzō) Many scholars think that such chieftaincies emerged during the fifth and sixth centuries under the auspices of the Yamato monarch, to whom the kuni-no-miyatsuko were closely linked. Earlier, in the third and fourth centuries, local elites known as agata chiefs (agatanushi) seem to have functioned as confederates in the Yamato-led confederacy. By the sixth century, increasing involvement in court activities bonded the kuni-no-miyatsuko ever more closely to the Yamato Great Kings. Current research identifies more than 120 kuni-no-miyatsuko, based from present-day Miyagi prefecture in the east to Kyūshū in the west. Frequently kuni-no-miyatsuko bore the kabane of atai, but some held more prestigious titles such as omi, kimi, and muraji. [県主、宮城、九州、姓、直（あたい）、臣（おみ）、君（きみ）、連（むらじ）]"
