        "Fujiwara no Munetada's (1062-1141) diary begins in 1087 and ends in 1139. Munetada was a mid-ranking Fujiwara who reached the top level within the imperial hierarchy, but it is in particular his years as head administrator for the chieftain that gives his diary a unique insight. By far one of the most important sources for the early insei era, giving an insider's view not only of the issues facing the clan as a whole but also of the procedures that mid-to high-level courtiers occupied themselves with."
