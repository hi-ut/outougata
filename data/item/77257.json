        "A key and padlock in the shape of a shrimp. The padlock consists of a rounded female part and a male portion that fits into it. These form a unit with a spoon-shaped key. The first Chinese character for the word sasu means chain\" indicating the derivation of the word from latching the door with a chain. Keys and latches are called sasu.\""
