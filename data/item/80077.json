        "One of the 12 heavenly deities and 8 directional deities, Fūen (Sk. Vāyu) is a Buddhist guardian of the northwest who in his person expresses the rapidity of the spiritual powers of the Buddha. His figure, which usually takes the appearance of an old man flying in windy air, takes on a slightly different appearance depending on the realm of the mandala."
