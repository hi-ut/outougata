        "tri-karma; cf., gō. These are (1) deeds of the body (shingō, kāya-karma); (2) of words, sound, voice (kugō, vāk-karma); and (3) of thought (igō, manah-karma). These parallel the Three Mysteries, or Teaching-practices\" (sammitsu, triguhya) of Mahāvairocana (Dainichi Nyorai), and when the identity of the two is realized experientially, the practitioner \"attains Buddhahood in his very body\" (sokushin jobutsu). See mikkyō; also Kiyota 1978. [業、身業、口業、意業、三密、大日如来、即身成仏、密教]\""
