        "a field survey, generally for the purpose of assessing taxes or rent. In the public domain such authority (kendenken 検田権) was vested in provincial government by mid-Heian times. The results were recorded in provincial maps (kokuzu 国図) and field survey registers (kendenchô 検田帳) which thus served as key documents for provincial administration.
