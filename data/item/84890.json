        "Food tribute sent to the Yamato king by confederate communities in the countryside. Such offerings probably initially represented first fruits dispatched to local chieftains. Later, they were sent to the Yamato paramount as well. Dispatch of ōnie continued to supply the royal table in the eighth century, a fact evidenced by stashes of wooden documents detailing shipments of royal table foods from many parts of the realm."
