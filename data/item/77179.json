        "Monochrome patterned textiles with single warps and single wefts in which the ground weave and pattern weave have different binding systems. The damask twills in this year's exhibition have either twill or tabby foundation bindings and twill pattern bindings. In Shōsō-in damasks with twill patterns over twill ground structures, the diagonal alignment of the pattern twill is more frequently oriented in a different direction from the ground twill(i.e. z twill pattern binding on s twill ground binding). Damask twills in which the diagonal alignment of both the ground and the pattern structures are the same (i.e. z twill pattern binding on  z twill ground binding) are rare in the eighth-century."
