        "This phrase, which expresses the notion that the buddhas, bodhisattvas (bosatsu, q. v.) and the Gods (kami) who are their local manifestations (cf., honji suijaku) soften the light\" of their wisdom and \"identify with the dust\" of human passions in order to save sentient beings, is borrowed from the Taoist Way and Its Power (Tao Te Ching, Dōtokukyō). [菩薩、神、本地垂迹、道徳経]\""
