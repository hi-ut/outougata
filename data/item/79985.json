        "Bifukumon'in (美福門院), also pronounced Mifukumon'in, with the original name of Fujiwara no Tokushi (藤原得子).  This empress of Toba tennō (r. 1107-23) who gave birth to the future sovereign Kono'e in 1139 convinced Toba to make the boy emperor in 1141 and following Kono'e's death in 1155 manipulated the succession process so that Go-Shirakawa acceded, an action which led to the Hōgen conflict in 1156.  She died aged 43 in 1160."
