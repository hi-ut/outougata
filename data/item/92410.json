        "A Japanese novel [by] a great-great-great granddaughter of Sugawa Machizane [written] in probably five books (kan), although the extant copies are in eight.  It is a novel patterned after the Genji monogatari concerning a certain Middle Counsellor (Chūnagon).  As it makes use of the doctrine of reincarnation, it tells, among other things, how the Middle Councellor found that his father had been born anew as a son to the reigning Emperor of the T'ang, so went to China, fell in love with his father's mother, and had a son by her! (Part A, p. 341) [菅原道真、巻、源氏物語、中納言]"
