        "Multiple signatures on a document. Sometimes this signified agreement on the part of normal rivals within an estate hierarchy. At other times it involved the signatures of various officers largely to strengthen the force of some order. Under the Bakufu, official decrees (gechijō) carried two signatures, one belonging to the 　Hōjō regent, the other belonging to a Hōjō cosigner.\"　[下知状、北条]　[Cf. Mass, 1982]\""
