        "Battle reports, representing a detailed record of wounds that were submitted to battle administrators (kassen bugyō), who rigorously inspected the documents, sometimes adding notations making them more precise. These reports often later became summarized in petitions for reward (gunchūjō) and hence, were less likely to be preserved than the later petitions. These reports had antecedents in late thirteenth-century petitions and complaints, which sometimes described violent acts in great detail. Although only a few fifteenth and sixteenth century kassen chūmon survive, this document remains unsurpassed as a means of reconstructing how warriors were wounded. [合戦奉行、軍忠状、合戦注文]"
