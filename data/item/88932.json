        "The most important of Enryakuji's five monzeki (noble cloisters). It was established as the residence of the forty-eighth head abbot, Gyogen (1093-1152), in the Toto section in the 1130s but was moved to the Sanjo-Shirakawa intersection in the eastern part of Kyoto by the mid -twelfth century. The best-known abbot of the Shoren'in was unquestionably Jien (1155-1225), who wrote the well-known Gukansho, an interpretative history of Japan."
