        "The diary of Emperor Fushimi (1265-1317), covering the years 1287-1311. Only nine of the original scrolls written by the emperor himself remain today. Nevertheless, it is a valuable source for the late Kamakura period, since Fushimi, as the son of Go-Fukakusa of the Jimyoin line, was involved in the split of the imperial line."
