        "Daigoji (J.) 醍醐寺, sometimes identified with the mountain of its location as Miyukisan (深雪山), Urumandasan (優留曼茶山), Mandasan (万茶山), Kasatoriyama (笠取山). The Shingon monk Shōbō (聖宝) is reputed to have taken up residence at Miyukisan as early as 874. Emperor Daigo was the sponsor of the founding of Daigoji as an imperial-decree temple\" (勅願寺 chokuganji) in 907. Kangen, who received denbō kanjō from Shōbō in 895, became the first abbot in 919. Together with Kajūji, Daigoji constituted one of the two centers of the Ono branch of Shingon. Moreover, its abbots and sponsors were almost exclusively of Murakami Genji heritage, and Daigoji became a site at which the ashes of both male and female aristocrats were interred from the late Heian era on.  \""
