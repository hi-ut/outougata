        "Chiinese braid was a broad, flad braid figured in polychrome lozenge designs and decorated with embroidery.  The purple yarn probably formed the ground color.  Chinese braid straps were used in the Court costumes of the higher nobility (Fifth Ranks and above) for tying on the ceremonial sword.  The end of the strap was allowed to hang down from the waist in front (p. 642n)."
