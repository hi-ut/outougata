        "The bodhisattva is one who vows to attain enlightenment. His practice on the path requires that he perfect a series of virtues, many of which entail helping others in distress and believers at earlier stages of the Buddhist path.  In Buddhist literature, a representative example of the ideal of the bodhisattva is that of the historical Buddha in earlier lives, illustrated in the jātaka tales.  Mahāyāna Buddhism, in particular, includes also a whole series of non-historical or celestial bodhisattvas such as Avalokiteśvara (観音 J. Kannon) who engage in similar activities.  In Japan, the term also applies to holy ones who have helped others and thus have been given the title by imperial decree or otherwise by popular attribution."
