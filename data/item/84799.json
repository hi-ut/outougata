        "a grid system employed for city planning, home-site distribution, and control of the populace in late seventh- and eighth-century capitals. Based on Chinese precedents, east-west avenues (jō) intersected north-south streets (bō) to form blocks (also bō) in the right capital (ukyō 右京) and left capital (sakyō 左京). Each block, and sixteen equal sub-blocks (tsubo 坪) into which a block might be divided, could thereby be located as to capital zone, ward, block, and sub-block number. Researchers believe that the system was initiated at the Fujiwara capital but it was at Nara that sub-blocks were first demarcated. The system matured further at Nagaoka and Heian. [藤原、奈良、長岡、平安]"
