        "The costume worn by noblemen on official business and when participating in court ceremonies.  The formal cloak (hō), in the colour appropriate to the wearer’s rank, was worn with a sword and a stone belt (sekitai) likewise matched to the wearer’s rank.  It was worn over a train-robe (shitagasane), which was a mid-thigh length garment with a train (kyo), worn in turn over gowns (akome, onzo, kinu, uchiki) and a shift (hitoe), with two pair of wide, open-legged trousers (hakama).  The costume was completed by the formal cap (kanmuri) and baton(shaku).  At least in later times, for somewhat less formal occasions, including ceremonies at home, the formality of this costume could be lowered by wearing gathered trousers (sashinuki) instead of trousers (hakama) and lowered still further (ikan) by omitting the belt and sword and using a narrow sash instead, and by carrying a fan instead of a baton.[袍、石帯、下襲、裾、衵・袙、御衣、衣、袿、単、袴、冠、尺、指貫、袴、衣冠][RK]"
