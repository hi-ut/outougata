        "One of the early Shingon monks famous for traveling to China. First entering Gangōji, Engyō studied the rites of the Womb and Diamond mandalas under Kūkai in 823, and received consecration from 杲隣 Gōrin (767-837) the same year. He became an officially recognized monk at Jingoji (Takaozan) the next year, and traveled with Ennin and others to China in 838. Receiving the denbō kanjō from the master 義真 (Ch. I-chen; J. Gishin) at Ch'ing-lung ssu in Ch'ang-an, he returned in 839 with a large number of Buddha relics, scriptures, treatises, as well as implements bequeathed originally by Hui-kuo. He later, upon imperial request, founded 霊巌寺 Reiganji (Yamashiro) and, later,  大山寺 Daisanji (Harima) before becoming the first bettō abbot of Shitennōji."
