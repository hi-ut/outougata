        "Lay administrators for one of the elite temples. The first zoku betto were appointed for Enryakuji in 823, in an attempt to establish some measure of insight into the Tendai center's affairs, since the temple was the first one to be granted an ordination platform of its own. The office quickly became popular among other temples as well, as Kofukuji, Todaiji, Kongobuji, and Koji all were connected with lay administrators in the first half of the ninth century. Though the office became superfluous in the late Heian period, zoku betto were sporadically appointed even in the Kamakura period."
