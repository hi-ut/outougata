        "the southern lineage, founded by Fujiwara Fuhito's eldest son, Muchimaro. Since the ritsuryō codes mandated that the eldest son by the senior wife be the father's heir, this lineage has long been considered the main line of Fuhito's descendants. But its primacy was challenged and eventually undermined by the northern (Hokke) and ceremonial (Shikike) lineages in the late Nara period. [藤原不比等、藤原武智麻呂、律令、北家、式家]"
