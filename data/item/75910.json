        "This guard unit was established in 890 by Uda Tennō to protect himself from the deposed and dangerously hostile Yōzei Tennō. Its members were non-nobles of the sixth-rank attached to the Royal Secretariat (Kurōdodokoro). In the late Heian Period the appointments became hereditary in warrior lines of the Taira and Minamoto clans. The guardpost where they were stationed was northeast of the Seiryōden.
