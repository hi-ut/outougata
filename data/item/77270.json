        "The mottled horny shell of a sea turtle, used as a decorative material. Techniques employed in the Shōsō-in treasures include its appliqué over gold leaf or polychrome painted designs and manipulated forms created through the use of heat. False tortoiseshell\" (J: ge-taimai) is an effect created when gold leaf is painted with brown or black mottled designs to resemble the natural substance. Though predominantly yellow coloration was preferred in early modern Japan, tortoiseshell in the Shōsō-in shows a preponderance of black mottles. Also bekkō.\""
