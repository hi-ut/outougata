        "A mobilization order, or more functionally, an invitation for warriors to report to battle. These documents, dispatched by either princes, generals, or ranking bakufu officials, did not entail any obligation to fight. Mere receipt of such a document could allow warriors to assert tozama status, which is why they were commonly preserved. [外様]"
