        "The theory that in order to save sentient beings, the various buddhas and bodhisattvas (as Original Ground,\" Essence) assume the forms of (or,\"manifest their traces as\") native divinities: as Chinese and Taoist sages in China, and as Shintō deities (kami) in Japan; see sanshin. A rather late attempt to explain the \"unification of the Gods and Buddha\" (shimbutsu shūgō), the theory takes its cue from the Tendai view that in the first 14 chapters of the Lotus Sutra (shakumon,\"trace teaching\"), Śākyamuni employs the Skillful Means (hōben, q. v.) of describing himself merely as a mortal; and that in the final 14 chapters (hommon, basic teaching\"), he reveals his eternal nature. This \"folklore\" tradition is adapted less successfully to the Shingon distinction between honji (essential body without attributes, the dharmakāya; see sanshin) and kaji (the manifested body as practitioner). See also wakō dōjin; also Kiyota 1978, 74-80, and Matsunaga 1969. [神、神仏習合、天台、迹門、方便、本門、真言、三身、加持、和光同塵]\""
