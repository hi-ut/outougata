        "Daiitoku myōō (大威徳明王), also referred to as Enmantokukya (閻曼徳迦), Enmantokukyainu-ō (閻曼徳迦威怒王), Rokusokuson (六足尊). One of the 5 or 8 awesome deities (daimyō), this deity was originally seen as a messenger of the Lord of Death Yama, and came to be seen as a transformation of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. In Japan, Daiitoku was from the late Heian era on  approached primarily in esoteric rites for victory in battle."
