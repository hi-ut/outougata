        "The Yōrō Code, which had not envisaged the institutionalization of the regency, had conceived of the Council of State as the supreme organ of government, with powers comparable to those of a modern cabinet.  During the Heian period, the Council consisted of Ministers of State (Daijin), Counselors (Nagon), and Consultants (Sangi)--in short, of most of the kugyō contingent--with offices held for life unless the incumbents rose to higher positions, resigned or, in rare cases, suffered dismissal.  Among its designated responsibilities were the supervision of the provincial and central bureaucracies, the formulation and enforcement of laws, appointments and promotions, the determination of precedents, the selection of auspicious dates, and the staging of rituals and ceremonies.  The increasing ceremonialization of its procedures, the diminishing substantive roles of many of its subordinate organs, and the creation of extra-Code bodies had eroded its authority by the tenth century, but none of its functions had lapsed completely in Michinaga's day. (p. 796) [養老令、大臣、納言、参議、公卿、藤原道長]"
