        "The narrow ribbons wrapped around the rims of containers and leather boxes are called himo. These strengthen as well as ornament. The name originates from the practice of hardening them with lacquer. Although this practice was common in the Nara period, by the Heian period they had started using metal reinforcements for rims."
