        "Fujiwara no Tadazane (J.) 藤原忠実, sometimes called 知足院,富家殿 Chisoku'in, Fukedono, religious name 円里 Enri. The son of the chancellor Moromichi (1062-99), Tadazane was raised by his grandfather, the regent and chancellor Morozane (1042-1101), and like his father and grandfather became head of the northern Fujiwaras. He became chancellor under the retired emperors Shirakawa and Toba, and was also made regent and prime minister under Toba. Although at odds with Shirakawa over his effort to make his daughter Taishi (Kaya-no-in; 1095-1155) empress for Toba, after Shirakawa's death he succeeded, and worked hard to revive the leadership of the northern Fujiwaras in the government and to increase their landholdings. Late in life he was on bad terms with his eldest son, chancellor 忠通 Tadamichi (1097-1164), and following the Hōgen war (1156) he left public life for good. Tadazane's literary legacy was his voluminous diary Denryaku, though he also wrote on court ritual."
