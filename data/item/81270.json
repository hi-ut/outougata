        "Fields designated to provide dues for temple or shrine that were therefore excused\" other taxes so that their tax yield could be forwarded directly to the temple or shrine. Such fields were known as the temple's (or shrine's) \"exempt fields\" (menden); when different fields each year were designated for this purpose, they were known as \"floating exempt fields\" (ukimen) (pp. 227-228).
