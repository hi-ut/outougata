        "(alt., kohori, hyō) a district or unit of provincial administration that emerged in the realm of Yamato Great Kings in the later seventh century. The term is thought to have derived from Korean. The district was presided over by a district chieftain, the kōri-no-miyatsuko 評造, who was ascriptively a member of the country chieftain stratum. Later, in the Taihō Code of 701, the kōri was replaced as the main unit of provincial administration by the gun. [大宝律令、郡]"
