        "Hōjō Akitoki (J.) 北条顕時, also called 金沢顕時、時方、越後四郎、越後入道、赤松殿 Kanezawa Akitoki, Tokikata, Echigo shirō, Echigo nyūdō, Akamatsudono. This son of Hōjō Sanetoki (1224-76) was a successful member of the bakufu until 1285, when his association with Adachi Yasumori (1231-85) led to his own exile upon the latter's defeat by Hōjō Sadatoki. At that time, he donated all of the land in the area of Shōmyōji to the temple, and later became a monk. Akitoki was very studious and devoted to Buddhism, and supported the efforts of Ken'a (1261-1338) to build up the document collection of Kanazawa Bunko on the grounds of Shōmyōji, dying in 1301."
