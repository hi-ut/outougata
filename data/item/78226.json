        "A Buddhist deity whose name means “the Unmoving.”  Fudō sits or stands on a rock, surrounded by flames.  Usually blue-black in colour, he holds an upraised sword in his right hand to cut down the demons of craving, and a noose in his left to bind them.  The principal deity of mountain ascetic rites, he was also the central deity of the Great Rite.[不動][RK]"
