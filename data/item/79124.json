        "A lacquer technique of decorative metal-sheet inlay used in lacquered woodwork or metalwork. Fine sheets of gold or silver are cut out and placed on a lacquered surface, which is then covered with anther coat of lacquer. Finally, the lacquer is peeled away from cutout areas. The cutouts themselves are usually further embellished with finely incised designs. Heidatsu differs slightly from the hyōmon technique, in which the lacquered surface of the metal inlay is polished off with charcoal, leaving an evenly imbedded decorative element.　[平文]"
