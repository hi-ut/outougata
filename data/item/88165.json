        "Also　shōzōmatsu.  (1) shōbō, sad-dharma. The age of the first thousand (sometimes 500) years after the historical Buddha's demise when doctrine, practice and attainment were prevalent. (2) zōbō, saddharma-pratirūpaka. The age of the Imitation [Image] of the Law, the next thousand years when doctrine and practice prevailed, but no attainment. (3) mappō (q. v.), saddharma-vipralopa. The age of the Decline of the Law, the final period when only the doctrine is known, but practice and attainment are no longer possible, as Nichiren, Hōnen and others had admonished.
