        "Refers to the long sleeves of the dancer’s robes that were waved five times as part of a dance. The gosechi-mai was one event during the Enthronement Festival (Daijōsai) in the year of a new tennō’s accession, or during the First Fruits Festival (Niinamesai) in other years. It took place on the middle days of the Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, and Dragon in the eleventh month. In the former case there were five dancers, and in the latter, four.  On the day of the Ox, the dancers and their escort of gentlewomen entered the Gosechi chamber in the Jōneiden. On the last day (that of the Dragon), there was the great court banquet known as the Warmth of Wine banquet (Toyo no Akari). On this occasion the Gosechi dancers danced the Dance of the Heavenly Maidens. On the day of the Rabbit, page girls (warawa) were viewed by the tennō (Dōjo Goran no Gi).
