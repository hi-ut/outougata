        "Daigo tennō (醍醐天皇). This emperor (r. 897-930), who acceded at age 12, had both Fujiwara no Tokihira 藤原時平 (871-909) and Sugawara no Michizane 菅原道真 (845-903) aid him in his active approach to politics, but through complying with Tokihira's effort to exile Michizane in 901 enabled the Fujiwara clan to completely dominate the imperial court."
