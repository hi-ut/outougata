        "Fujiwara no Sanesuke (J.) 藤原実資, also known as 小野宮 Ono-no-miya. This grandson (and foster child) of Saneyori (900-970) was known in aristocratic circles for his willingness to perform the rite to make his sister the empress of Sanjō tennō (r. 1011-16)--defying the will of the powerful Michinaga--and rose to the position of minister of the right. He also wrote the massive diary Shōyūki and the ceremonial manual 小野宮年中行事 Ono-no-miya nenjū　gyōji, dying at the age of 89 in 1046."
