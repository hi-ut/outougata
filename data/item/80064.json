        "Fujiwara no Saneyori (J.) 藤原実頼, sometimes called 小野宮殿 Ono-no-miya dono; posthumous name 清慎公 Seishinkō and, later, 尾張公 Owarikō. The son of Tadahira (880-949), this powerful aristocrat became regent in addition to chancellor following the displacement of minister of the right Minamoto no Takaakira (914-82) and others in the Anna incident (969). His monopolization of both posts provided the groundwork for the northern Fujiwaras to exclusively lay claim to them. Saneyori was also an expert in court ritual protocol, and is known as the founder of the Ono line of court ceremony."
