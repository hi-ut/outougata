        "The five branches-Ichijō, Nijō, Kujō, Konoe, Takatsukasa-into which the Fujiwara regent's line (sekkanke) split during the thirteenth century. Another Fujiwara branch-the Saionji-assumed control of the consort (gaiseki) relationship with the imperial house, thereby divesting the regent's line of its historic right to provide or select empresses.　[一条、二条、九条、近衛、鷹司、摂関家、西園寺、外戚]"
