        "An abbreviated ceremony was held in lieu of the customary Shun rites, after which the list of attendees was memorialized to the throne. [旬]  A truncated form of the Shun no matsurigoto — the ceremony held of the one day in each third (shun) of a month on which the sovereign was meant to attend political discussions — which was held when the sovereign did not attend. The ceremony was held in truncated form, after which the nobles perform gezan. This consisted of a record of those attending being made, which was shown to the sovereign in his residential pavilion (Seiryōden), after which the sovereign acknowledged receipt of the list. The nobles then lined up in front of the Shishiiden in order of rank, and made obeisance to the sovereign in the Shishiiden (even though the sovereign was not present in the building), before departing.
