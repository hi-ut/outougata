        "Slender five-foot rods, covered with paper at the top, which were tied together in bundles of two, three, or four, and presented to the Emperor in Shishinden by members of the Guards on the first Day of the Hare in a new year.  The wood came from trees associated with the yang principle in yin-yang cosmology (camellia, peach, plum, etc.), and the choice of the Day of the Hare represented an attempt, based on Chinese precedent, to utilize the evil-despelling powers of a yang animal associated with spring and the east.  The custom flourished particularly in the mid-Heian period, when the wands were presented on tree-dotted landscape trays--often with the tips held in the mouth of the animal corresponding to the Emperor's lucky direction.  After the Shishinden ceremony, the wands were taken to the Daytime Cahmber of the Seiryōden, where they served not only a protective but also a decorative purpose.  Uzue were also presented to members of the Imperial Family by the Court, and to one another by the nobility in general.[紫宸殿、清涼殿]"
