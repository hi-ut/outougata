        "This monk studied Sanron and mikkyō under Kanri (894-974) at Tōdaiji as well as Gengō (911-95) at Ishiyamadera before catching a boat to China in 983. He traveled to the capital and to sacred sites such as Wu-t'ai shan, and brought back large quantities of scriptures as well as a ﾚākyamuni image upon his return in 987. Two years later, he became abbot of Tōdaiji, and hoped to construct a temple for the Buddha image, but died before realizing his plans in 1016; his disciple, the Shingon monk 盛算 Jōsan (961-?), completed construction of the Seiryōji later."
