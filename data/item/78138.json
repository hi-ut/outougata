        "The Buddha of infinite light, who presides over a paradise located immeasurably far away towards the west.  According to his great vow, all who call his name (in the formula “Namu Amida Butsu,” known as the Nenbutsu) will achieve rebirth into this paradise, and this invocation was therefore the single most common Buddhist practice in the author’s time.  Usually voiced, it was recited silently for a funeral. [南無阿弥陀仏、念仏] [RK]"
