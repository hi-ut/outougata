        "Petition for rewards, documents submitted by warriors demanding compensation for their military service (chūsetsu) which described how and when they fought, and which damages that they incurred. These documents were the hallmark of tozama warrior status, and arose out of military practices during the Mongol Invasions of the 1274 and 1281. Most common in the fourteenth century, these documents became progressively rarer as armies became more systematically organized, and military service became more obligatory. See also chakutōjō, kanjō, kassen chūmon, and tozama.[忠節、外様、着倒状、感状、合戦注文]"
