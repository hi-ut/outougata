        "A temple-shrine complex, located some twenty miles south of Nara (close to present-day Sakurai City). The Tomomine peak became the location for the mausoleum of Fujiwara no Kamatari, the Fujiwara patriarch, probably in the Nara period. However, a monk named Son'ei, who was trained at Enryakuji's Mudoji cloister, retired to Tonomine, where he began to attract many students with his Tendai teachings in the early years of the eleventh century. Son'ei was succeeded at Mudoji by a certain Kenmei, who was close to the most dominating courtier at the time, Fujiwara no Michinaga. Since Tonomine lacked affiliation with a central temple, Son'ei asked Michinaga to make it a branch of Enryakuji. Despite protests from Kofukuji, Michinaga allowed Son'ei's temple, now known as Myorakuji, to become affiliated with Enryakuji, making the shrine-temple complex a Tendai foothold in Yamato. Disputes were subsequently common between Tonomine and Kofukuji in the late Heian and Kamakura eras."
