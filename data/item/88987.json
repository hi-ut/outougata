        "The diary of Nakayama Tadachika (1132-1195), the son of Fujiwara no Munetada (see Chuyuki), who reached mid-to high-ranking courtier offices, serving in particular consorts at the imperial court. Tadachika's diary spans the years from 1151 to 1194, though much of it has been lost. In fact, there is not one single complete year remaining today. Tadachika, an accomplished writer and poet, does, however, offer an interesting inside view of the imperial court."
