        "Also genbuku.↓A Heian youth's Coming-of Age ceremony, which took place when he was from ten to fifteen years old, was one of the turning points in his life, a true rite of passage.  Before it, he wore a child's hair style and costume and answered to a child's name; afterward, his coiffure, clothing, and name were those of an adult, he was eligible for marriage, and, if his family were sufficiently influential, he obtained Court Rank and began his climb up the official ladder (pp. 372-3)."
