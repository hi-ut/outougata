        "Often used as a generic term for any woven textile with multicolored yarns. More specifically, it refers to compound twill weaves with more than one set of warps or wefts. Tate nishiki is a warp-faced compound twill and nuki nishiki is a weft-faced compound twill. The nishiki textiles in this year's exhibition are all of the latter structure and have both a binding foundation warp and a secondary hidden warp (often in pairs) , used to manipulate the patterns and movement of the multicolored weft yarns. The Nara-period nuki nishiki textiles have a distinct structure, different from those of the subsequent Heian period. [経錦、緯錦]"
