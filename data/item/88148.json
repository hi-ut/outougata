        "satya-dvaya. The multiplicity of the world viewed as arising interdependently is Empty (kū, q. v.) of any permanent self or substance (muga; see under mujō entry); this is the Ultimate or Absolute Truth (shintai, paramārtha satya). The same world viewed empirically, however, has an undeniable provisional existence (ke); this is the complementary Conventional Truth (zokutai, samvrti satya). (See Murti 1960, 243-255.) Hence the famous statement of the Hannya shingyō: Form is no other than emptiness, Emptiness is no other than Form\" (shiki soku ze kū, kū soku ze shiki). To these Tendai thought adds a Truth of the Middle (chūtai) between these two extremes, to create a doctrine of Three Truths (santai). [空、無我、無常、真諦、化、俗諦、般若心経、色即是空空即是色、中諦、三諦]\""
