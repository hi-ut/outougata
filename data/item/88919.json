        "(?-1183) A Minamoto descendant who became one of the most prominent Tendai head abbots in the premodern era. Well liked by the Enryakuji clergy, he was appointed Tendai zasu in 1166 but deposed by Go-Shirakawa in 1177. Owing to his close ties with Taira no Kiyomori, Myoun was reinstated in 1179. He remained a supporter of the Taira during the Genpei War but made peace with Go-Shirakawa, which cost him his life in 1183, when he stayed at the retired emperor's palace in Kyoto as Kiso Yoshinaka attacked the capital."
