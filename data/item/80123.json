        "Gyōrin shō (J.) 行林抄, also referred to as 戒光記 Kaikōki. Lengthy collection of Tendai esoteric instructions for rites to a variety of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other deities by the monk Jōnen (fl. mid-12th c.), who studied under the master 相実 Sōjitsu (1081-1165) was thus the heir to the Hōman-ry・lineage on Mount Hiei. Insofar as his teacher Sōjitsu studied Hirosawa and Ono branch teachings of Shingon in addition to Tendai, and Gyōrin shō had a strong influence on the compilation of 阿婆縛抄 Asaba shō by the monk 承澄 Shōchō (1205-81), it constitutes a valuable resource for knowledge of the character of Tendai esoteric ritual in the early medieval era."
