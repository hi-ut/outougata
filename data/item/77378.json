        "Garments with V\" necks and overlapping front panels, these were among the ceremonial robes worn by men in the Nara period. The term is used in contrast with round-collared garments like the hō. By the Kamakura period (1185-1333) \"v\" necked robes such as the hitatare, suō and daimon, became standard wear. The kosode and its modern-day variation, the kimono, are also tarikubi garments. [直垂、素襖、大紋] \""
