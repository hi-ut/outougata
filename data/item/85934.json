        "A phonetically arranged dictionary of rhymes by Sugawara no Koreyoshi.  This lexicon in twenty chapters was compiled from thirteen Chinese rhyming dictionaries.  It gave the definitions and pronunciations of Chinese characters arranged according to their tones and rhymes, a classification particularly useful to students of T'ang-style regulated verse, which had strict rules concerning both tone patterns and rhyme.  For each character, Koreyoshi carefully cited the various definitions and pronunciations given in his Chinese sources (pp. 60-61).  [菅原是善]"
