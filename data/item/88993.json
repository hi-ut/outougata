        "A war chronicle in forty volumes covering Go-Daigo's reign from 1318 through the Kemmu Restoration to the 1360s. The author appears to have been a monk, perhaps of Tendai or Zen lineage, who was sympathetic to the Southern Court. The majority of the chronicle was completed around 1371, but other sections appear to have been added on later. Though sometimes tedious in its descriptions of battles, there is some valuable information regarding the various factions and the involvement of religious institutions."
