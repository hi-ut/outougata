        "A ceremony performed annually for the court and the imperial state at Kufukuji. It was based on the Yuima Sutra, which describes the activities of Buddhist laypeople, indicating that people who had not taken the Buddhist vows could perform meritorious deeds. The Yuima ceremony, which is said to have originated at Yamashinadera under the patronage of Fujiwara no Kamatari (614-669) and then reintroduced by Fuhito at Kofukuji in honor of his father, therefore became quite popular with the nobility in the Nara and Heian eras."
