        "A festival to celebrate the yearly meeting of the Ox boy and the Weaving Girl stars held on the seventh day of the seventh month. An event for women to wish for excellence in their artistic activities, thread, needles, and stringed instruments play a central role in the festivities. This old Chinese custom was brought to Japan in the Nara period."
