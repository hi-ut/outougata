        "The Sweet-Flag Festival, celebrated on the Fifth of the Fifth Month at Court and elsewhere, represented an effort to ward off the diseases that tended to strike with the onset of hot weather.  It embraced a variety of ceremonies and customs, most of them involving the aromatic leaves and roots of the sweet flag, or calamus (Acorus calamus var. angustatus), to which the Chinese and Japanese, like the medieval Europeans, ascribed medicinal properties (p. 412)."
