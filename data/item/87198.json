        "(r. 1680-1709)  The fifth shogun was the first to be selected from among several possible candidates.  Iemitsu's fourth son, Tsunayoshi had served as a daimyo as the adopted head of the Tatebayashi house and thus had developed his own ideas regarding shogunal policy before assuming that office.  Although a patron of Confucian political philosophy, his reputation was tarnished by some of his extreme policies, exemplified by his ordinances protecting animals, notably dogs.  He was the first shogun to use the office of grand chamberlain (sobayōnin) as a means of bypassing the Senior Council, thus earning the resentment of many entrenched fudai daimyo (p. 20).
