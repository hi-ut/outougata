        "Originating in India with the development of Mahayana Buddhism, it emphasizes secret mystical incantations and mudras (hand positions) . Though it did not take firm root in Japan until the Heian period, beginning in the ninth century, esoteric Buddhism had already been introduced to Japan in the Nara period in an older and less complete form."
