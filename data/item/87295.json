        "(Ch. k'an-ho) A license to trade in China in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, originally issued by the Ming government to the king of Japan\"--the shogun--who in turn distributed them to Japanese who wished to trade.  Ashikaga Yoshimitsu had accepted \"vassal-state\" status in the Ming tribute system in order to obtain investiture as king of Japan, and thereby control the kangō, the sine qua non of direct access to China.  Yoshimitsu's control of the distribution of kangō thus gave him a powerful tool with which to control recalcitrant shugo and religious institutions. [足利義満、守護] \""
