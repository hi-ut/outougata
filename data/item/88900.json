        "A shrine-temple complex located south of Kyoto, founded by the monk Gyokyo in 860 as a worship hall for the war god Hachiman. The complex soon became a sacred protector for the imperial state, assuming a place among the highest-ranking shrines in Japan. It was a prominent presence in Yamashiro Province and received consistent patronage and visits from the Kyoto nobility. Contrary to many other prestigious shrines, Iwashimizu lacked a strong affiliation with any of the kenmon temples."
