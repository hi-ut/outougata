        "Moneylenders begin to appear in documents from 1234 as dosō,\" after their sturdy fireproof earthen storehouses erected to safeguard pawned items... The word \"dosō\" appears for the first time in the Kamakura period, indicating a sturdy building with earthen walls... In addition to lending money, [moneylender] stored and protected cash and valuables in return for a deposit fee. They also managed their patrons' landed income, performing such services as tax farming and transporting goods from distant estates... \"Financier\" or \"financial house\" is perhaps a more suitable word for the larger dosō (p. 39).\""
