        "In the Kamakura period, a province-level constable\" appointed by the bakufu who acted as liaison officer between the bakufu and its provincial vassals, and held primary responsibility for the suppression of local rebellions and major crimes. In the Muromachi period the shugo was a provincial military governor appointed by the bakufu. (See Mass, Kamakura Bakufu) Shugo became great territorial lords, acquiring most of the authority formerly held by the provincial governors under the ritsuryō system. Modern historians have coined the name shugo daimyō to describe such powerful shugo of the last half of the Muromachi period.　[幕府、律令]\""
