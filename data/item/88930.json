        "The Holy Tree, referring to a branch (or branches) of the sacred sakaki tree (Cleyera ochnacea) that was carried to the capital in protest by certain shrines, including Kumano and Kasuga. The branch was put on a platform and equipped with sacred mirrors before it was taken out for a goso. It is belived that protesters often carried a branch with withering leaves to the capital to indicate the deteriorating state of the shrine and the anger of the gods, replacing it with a fresh one when they had been obliged."
