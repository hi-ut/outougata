        "Ministry of Popular Affairs. The minkan corresponds to China's min-pu shang-shu 民部尚書, or Minister of Revenue, a title which began to be used in 583 at the start of the Sui and was changed to hu-pu shang-shu 戸部尚書 in 649 during the T'ang, and it is therefore evident that it was modeled on the organization of government offices from at least the early Sui to before the promulgation of the Yung-hui Codes."
