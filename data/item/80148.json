        "This small-scale war (1156) between factions aligned variously with the emperor (Go-Shirakawa) and retired emperor (Sutoku) highlighted the difficulties inherent in the retired emperor system as well as the centrality of leaders of the samurai to the resolution of problems in the era. Figures such as Fujiwara noTadazane, Fujiwara no Yorinaga, and Sutoku lost, while the samurai leaders Minamoto no Yoshitomo and Taira no Kiyomori as well as Fujiwara no Tadamichi and Go-Shirakawa won. Within 4 years, however, Yoshitomo and Kiyomori would do battle in the Heiji conflict, ending the life of Yoshitomo and ensuring the ascendance of the Tairas for the next 2 decades."
