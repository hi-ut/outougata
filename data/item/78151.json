        "Literally, \"morning face.\"  This is now the name of the morning glory, but many scholars doubt that the asagao of the earlier chapters, especially the one directly associated with Princess Asagao, is that flower.  The leading possibility otherwise is the kikyō (Platycodon grandiflorum), the “Chinese bellflower,” a sort of bluebell.  In “Asagao” the beauty of the asagao is described in terms of nioi, a term associated with red, purple, violet, or yellow, but not with pure blue or white, the only colours known for the morning glory in Heian times.  (Red, purple, and so on did not appear until the Muromachi).  “Bluebell” therefore appears in this translation in the chapters covering Genji’s life.  However, the asagao of “Yadorigi” seems indeed to be the morning glory, since the passage so insists on the very transience for which the morning glory is known; moreover the kikyô is mentioned by name in “Tenarai.”[朝顔、桔梗、室町、源氏、宿木、手習][RK]"
