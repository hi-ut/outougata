        "Literally, the Latter Age of the Law,\" an expression of Buddhist millennialism. In the cyclical view of time and history associated with Buddhism, mappō represents the last of the three ages of the Buddhist law. It is an epoch so distant in time from the Buddha's lifetime that his teachings grew dim, and the ability of humankind to benefit from them weakened.\""
