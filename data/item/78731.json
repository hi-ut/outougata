        "A gentleman individually authorized by the Emperor to enter the privy chamber.  The term referred more specifically to those gentlemen of the fourth and fifth ranks, together with Chamberlains (Kurōdo) of the sixth rank, who would not otherwise have enjoyed the privilege automatically granted the top three ranks.  The number of privy gentlemen varied but usually fell below one hundred and was sometimes less than a third of that.[蔵人][RK]"
