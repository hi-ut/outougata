        "The Wheel Kings are ideal monarchs who rule the world by turning the wheel of righteous political power bestowed by heaven.  There are four types, distinguished by the metals of their wheels:  gold, silver, copper, and iron.  According to one source, an Iron Wheel King ruled one of the four continents of the world when the life span of man was 100 years, and a Gold Wheel King ruled the entire world when the life span was 80,000 years (p. 767 n.)"
