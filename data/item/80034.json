        "Monk of the Hossō school who through his relationship with reigning empress Shōtoku almost gained control over the imperial court. Having trained to some degree in esoteric ritual, Dōkyō performed the 宿曜法 sukuyō hō successfully for her recovery from illness in the early 760s, and meteorically rose in imperially appointed clerical rank until he was made King of the (Buddhist) Law (法王 hōō) in 766. He attempted to orchestrate a rise to the position of emperor through use of an oracle at Usa Jingū in 769, but proved unsuccessful, effectively exiled to a temple in rural Japan until his death in 772."
