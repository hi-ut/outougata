        "A diary written by Minamoto no Tsuneyori (985-1035), who served as a mid-ranking bureaucrat at the imperial court. Covering the years 1016-1036, the diary is one of the earliest written by a Minamoto, offering insight into the workings of the imperial court and the Fujiwara clan's organization."
