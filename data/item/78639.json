        "A gagaku piece.  Its title as used in the tale alludes to Genji’s status as the Honorary Retired Emperor, since a Retired Emperor was commonly imagined as a Taoist Immortal and inhabited a Sentō Gosho (“Palace of the Cave of the Immortal”).  Immortals (sennin) were supposed to sport among the mists of mountain peaks and to need no other food.[源氏、仙洞御所、仙人][RK]"
