        "“mouthfield”—officially opened rice fields that were distributed to registered residence units (represented by the head) based on the number of registered subjects therein. According to the ritsuryô codes, cultivators were to use the fields during their lifetimes, gaining livelihood therefrom and paying various forms of tax-tributes (chô, yô, sô) to the tennô’s government. After a cultivator died, his fields were to be redistributed by provincial authorities. However, the processes of registration and redistribution on which the system depended ceased early in the ninth century. [律令] [調] [庸] [租] [天皇]"
