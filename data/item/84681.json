        "Also called Nijō Tominokōji Palace, Reizei Tominokōji Mansion, and Tominokōji Mansion. A town palace (sato dairi) located north of Nijō and west of Tominokōji; used in the late Kamakura period. Originally a residence  of Saionji Saneuji, it had been used on two occasions by Emperor Go-Fukakusa after fires at the kan-in Palace, and had later become a principal palace for sovereigns of the Jimyō-in Line. In 1312, after a destructive fire, the bakufu provided resources for an extensive new establishment modeled on the Heian-period imperial palace. Construction was completed in1317, and the palace was occupied successively by Emperors Hanazono, Go-Daigo, and Kōgon. It burned in 1336. [二条, 冷泉, 里内裏, 西園寺実氏, 後深草, 持明院, 花園天皇, 後醍醐天皇, 光厳天皇]"
