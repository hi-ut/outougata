        "The inner side of this movable partition [that stood at the north end of Seiryōden's a wide corridor beneath the outer eaves], which resembles a modern fusuma, depicted men with grotesquely elongated limbs fishing on a rocky, wave-lashed shore, a subject based on a Chinese legend recorded in the Shan-hai-ching (p. 841).
