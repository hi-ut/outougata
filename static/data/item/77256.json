        "Also Sassanid (c.224-c.640). The last dynasty of native rulers to reign in persia before the Arab conquest, with a domain covering a wide span from the Black Sea in the west to Central Asia in the east. The Sassanians revived the traditional Iranian culture of the Achaemenids (c. 550-330 B.C.), while at the same time incorporating influence from the Roman Empire and Mesopotamia, creating a unique culture of their own. The metalwork, glass, textiles, and other arts of this dynasty were of superior quality and broadly influenced cultures to the east and the west. After the fall of the capital, Ctesiphon, to the Arabs in 636, a great number of Sassanian nobility and artisans fled to China, where their presence had a great influence on the arts at the height of the Tang dynasy. Sassanian art came to Japan via the Silk Road, by way of China."
