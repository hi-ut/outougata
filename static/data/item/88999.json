        "A chronicle of the Tōnomine complex, written in 1197 by a monk named Join. The chronicle is divided into several sections, including Buddhist procedures and specific information regarding buildings and construction. The early parts of the chronicle are especially useful for Tonomine's initial developments and the Kofukuji attacks on the complex."
