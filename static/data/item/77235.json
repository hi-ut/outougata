        "Diospyros kaki. Japanese persimmon. Black persimmon\" refers to the darkcolored heartwood that can form in the core section of persimmon trees. Highly prized in the Nara period for its ornamental qualities, it was even simulated by painting other woods with mottled patterns, termed \"false black persimmon.\"\""
