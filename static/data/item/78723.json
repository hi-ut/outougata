        "A festival held on the fifth day of the fifth month.  The Emperor went to the Butokuden and bestowed herbal balls (kusudama) on the assembled courtiers, who were crowned with sweet flag (ayame, calamus, a fragrant medicinal plant).  Horseraces (kurabeuma, races between pairs of horses) were held as well.  The event was abolished in 968, but the custom of adorning the roof of one’s house or one’s own person with sweet flag roots persisted long afterwards.[薬玉、菖蒲、競馬][RK]"
