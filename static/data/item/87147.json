        "[Christian name:] Dom Justo, 1552? - 1615.  Takayama Ukon [developed] into the Jesuits' prize pupil even as he pursued the bloody career of a Sengoku and Momoyama warlord.  A striking exception among the Christian daimyo of Japan, he persevered in his faith under persecution.  At the beginning of the Tokugawa era, he was exiled from his country for his religious convictions and died on foreign soil, in Manila (p. 320). [大名]"
