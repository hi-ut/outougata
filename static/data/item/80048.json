        "Shingon monk of unknown origins who studied under the teachers 宗叡 Shūei (809-84), Shōbō, and 禅念 Zennen (?-908). In particular, under the tutelage of Shōbō he became a renowned artist among Buddhist clerics, producing images such as a Senju Kannon at Tōji, the Yakushi nyorai figure at Daigoji, as well as overseeing the production of the five-story stūpa at Tōji and the reproduction of Buddha images in the lecture hall at Tōdaiji. Eri rose in clerical rank to second level abbot of Tōji."
