        "The ashiginu in the Shōｓō-in came to the national government as tax cloth from provinces across Japan. Originally, the term referred to poor-quality cloth woven in Japan, as opposed to finer textiles imported from China. Over time, however, the quality of domestic silk production increased and the discrepancies between the two countries disappeared.　[正倉院]"
