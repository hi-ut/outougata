        "The most influential of the six Nara sects, Hosso had Kofukuji as its headquarters. The sect sought to distinguish the real nature of things from their worldly appearance through intensive studies of several sacred texts. It originated in India but reached Japan from China for the first time in 653. Because of its focus on reading and intellectual activities, the Hosso sect became especially popular among the ultimate elites, as it also served to distinguish the well educated and cultured from members of the lower nobility."
