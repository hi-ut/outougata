        "A regular New Year observance at the palace.  On the fourteenth day of the first month, six song-leaders (katō, of Left and Right), as well as dancers and musicians chosen from among the privy gentlemen (tenjōbito) and the lesser ranks (jige), would appear before the residence of the Emperor, the Empress, the Retired Emperor, and so on, dancing and singing saibara songs.  The practice lapsed in 983.  Women performed mumming too, but not in the tale.[歌頭,殿上人,地下][RK]"
