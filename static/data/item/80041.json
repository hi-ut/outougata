        "Enchin (J.) 円珍, also called 遠塵 Enjin; posthumous name 智証大師 Chishō daishi. Nephew of Kūkai, Enchin was together with Ennin one of only two early monks of the Tendai school who had a thorough training in the Chen-yen (J. Shingon) esoteric tradition of China (i.e., before the advent of Annen). After his study in China (853-58), Enchin imported many continental texts and wrote large quantities of works--particularly on esoteric Buddhism. Enchin lectured on the Mahāvairocana Sūtra and performed the Womb realm consecration (胎蔵灌頂 taizō kanjō) in the Jijūden of the palace in 864. Four years later, he became the 5th abbot in the history of Enryakuji, and proceeded to establish a platform for consecration purposes at Onjōji. His close ties the court continued, as he was lecturer on the Benevolent Kings scripture for the emperor, and became the lead Buddhist lecturer in the Jijūden."
