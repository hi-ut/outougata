        "Sons or brothers of capital or district officials whose martial skills qualified them for guard service at court. Eight hundred such men made up the Hyōefu 兵衛府, or Headquarters of the Palace Guards, which was divided into left and right units. In the case of sons and brothers of district chiefs, service as hyōe often preceded appointment as district chieftain. Many scholars view the hyōe as the institutional descendants of the earlier toneri, who had once guarded the Great King's palace. [舎人]"
