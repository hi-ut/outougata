        "Divine palanquins that were taken out from shrines for protests (goso) as well as for festivals. The carts are belived to contain the kami residing in the shrine and must thus be treated with much caution. There is usually a sacred object, such as a mirror, inside, while other mirrors are also hung outside to reflect the power of the kami. An alternative reading is mikoshi,\" which is the contemporary term for these carts.\""
