        "Dōshō (J.) 道昭、also written as 道照. Gangōji monk who traveled to China in 653 and studied Hossō teachings under Hsüan-tsang as well as meditation practice under Hui-man. Returning to Japan in 660, he taught Hossō at Gangōji until his death in 700. Dōshō is also known to have brought back large numbers of scriptures and treatises from China, and his voluntary construction  activities influenced his pupil Gyōki to do likewise."
