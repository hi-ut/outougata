        "Byakuja hō  (避蛇法), sometimes pronounced hija.  This is one of the most guarded secret rites in Shingon tradition, and can be traced historically to the account in article 23 of the so-called 25-article Last Testament attributed to Kūkai.  Invariably interpreted as a form of the wish-fulfilling jewel rite, the name has been explained in a variety of ways--the most prominent being that the name refers to the effort to exorcise the ritual site of the influence of evil dragons, or that it is homonymous with the term for good/white serpent (白蛇 byakuja) and thus draws on the powers of the dragon guarding the pond of Mount Murō."
