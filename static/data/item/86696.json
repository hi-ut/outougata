        "In the Niigata area, the chumon-zukuri, an L-shaped plan containing living quarters, work area-cum-kitchen, and stable, seems originally to have been a style used by the samurai.  Despite seventeenth-century regulations banning the use of this plan for lower level samurai and commoners, in time the chumon-zukuri became the favored house style for the upper levels of the farming communities (p. 702)."
