        "Instituted in 702, the office was an extracodal one (ryōgekan). Advisors frequently held the fourth rank, and it was from this position that courtiers won promotion to the higher-ranking Council offices of counselor (nagon 納言) and minister (daijin 大臣). Originally there were five advisors; later there were six, and by early Heian times the number of advisors was set at eight. During Nara times it became customary to appoint any courtier holding the third rank who did not have a regular seat on the Council to the post of hisangi 非参議, advisor at large. [令外官]"
