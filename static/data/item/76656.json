        "A Buddhist rite that included reading the Kūmārājīva translation of the Lotus Sutra in eight rolls, one roll per service. The hakkō service was generally performed at memorial services in the hopes of transferring merit to the deceased to ensure his or her salvation. The service included lectures on the Lotus Sutra itself.  Beginning in the tenth century, the structure of these lectures included a questioning period that sometimes led to heated debates mediated by judges. Readings at memorial services were often infused with great ceremony. Proceedings on the fifth day would include a procession recreating scenes from the Lotus Sutra. See Willa Jane Tanabe, “The Lotus Lectures, Hokke Hakko in the Heian Period, Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. 39, No. 4. (Winter, 1984), pp. 393-407."
