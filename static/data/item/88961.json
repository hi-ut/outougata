        "The Honen shonin eden is a tribute to the Buddhist saint Honen (1133-1212), glorifying his life while vilifying many of his opponents. It was completed in 1307,probably by Shunjo, a ninth-generation direct disciple of Honen. The accompanying text was contributed by prominent courtiers and emperors within the next decade."
