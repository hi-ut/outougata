        "Fugen enmei (bosatsu) (J.) 普賢延命（菩薩）, sometimes referred to as 大安楽不空真実金剛 Daianraku fukūshinjitsu kongō. Main object of worship in the 普賢延命法 Fugen enmei hō, Fugen enmei is an esoteric form of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra approached usually in rituals for longevity. The Tendai iconographic form has 2 arms, the most famous example being that held in Matsuodera (Kyoto, late Heian era); this bodhisattva held a particularly important place in Tendai esotericism, as the Fugen enmei hō was one of the 4 so-called great rites performed by the monks of Enryakuji. The Shingon form has 20 arms, a representative example being that held in Jikōji (Hiroshima, late Heian era). In Japan, insofar as this bodhisattva could be approached  for purposes of safe childbirth, the Fugen enmei hō was frequently sponsored by the imperial family, beginning in 1075."
