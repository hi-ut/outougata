        "Tendai/Hokekyō doctrine that says that the three traditional divisions of Buddhism known as the Three Vehicles (sanjō) are no more than an expedient device created by Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha, to lead people of different initellectual and spiritual capacities to the One Vehicle that will ultimately carry each and every sentient being to Buddhahood (p. 468).
