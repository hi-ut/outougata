        "A yellowish alloy of 80% copper and 20% tin, which has been tempered to increase hardness and durability. Sahari is found frequently in the Shōsō-in in tableware and Buddhist implements, including nested bowls, ewers, dishes, and spoons. It is also called kyōdō (echoing bronze) for its resonance. The Wamyō　ruijūshō - Japan's first character dictionary, dating to the early tenth century - states that the word sahari\" is a phonetic corruption of a Silla Korean word, but there is also evidence of roots in Persian.
