        "a period of summer retreat for Buddhist monks and nuns. Buddhist monastic custom required Buddhist monastics to assemble for study and worship during India's wet summer months. In the archipelago, references in the chronicles show that such assemblies, and accompanying rites called angoe 安居会, were held at official temples during the seventh and eighth centuries."
