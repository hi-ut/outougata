        "A festival that accompanied the Enthronement Festival (Daijōsai) in the year of a new Emperor's accession, or the First Fruits Festival (Niinamesai) in other years; it took place on the middle days of the Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, and Dragon in the eleventh month.  In the former case there were five dancers and in the latter four; of these, in a Niinamesai year, two came from among the senior nobles and two (three in a Daijōsai year) from among the privy gentlemen or provincial Governors.  On the day of the Ox the dancers and their escort of gentlewomen entered the Gosechi chamber in the Jôneiden.  On the last day (that of the Dragon) there was the great court banquet known as Warmth of Wine (Toyo no Akari), and on this occasion the Gosechi dancers danced the dance of the heavenly maidens.  On the day of the Rabbit the page girls (warawa) were viewed by the Emperor (dōjō goran no gi).[大嘗祭、新嘗祭、五節、常寧殿、豊明、童、堂上御覧の儀][RK]"
