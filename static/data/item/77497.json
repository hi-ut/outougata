        "Five altar rituals, were designed to harness the powers of the five wisdom kings, and protect the state (see chōbukuhō). First performed in the palace in the eleventh century, they maintained considerable importance. Go-Daigo apparently attributed his destruction of Kamakura to these rituals, which constituted an important prerogative of sovereignty. Takauji, the first Ashikaga shōgun, and his brother Tadayoshi, had these rituals performed in their own residences, which marked a significant blurring of sovereign authority. [調伏法、後醍醐、足利尊氏、足利直義]"
