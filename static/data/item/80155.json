        "This powerful member of the shogunate rose to be regent of the bakufu in 1246, and sided with his maternal grandfather Adachi Kagemori (?-1248) against the Miuras in the Hōji battle (1247), destroying the latter and establishing complete dominance of the Kamakura bakufu by the Hōjō clan. He died in 1263 at the age of 36."
