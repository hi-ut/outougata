        "Currently, this term represents a type of armor fastened together on the right side. Although is more appropriate for combat on foot, this armor is of significantly higher quality than haramaki. The first reference to dōmaru appears in the 1270s. Several examples of this armor, fastened on the side, exist for the fourteenth century. Suits of dōmaru were embellished with accouterments, including leggings, gloves, shin guards and face guards (hōate). [腹巻、頬当]"
