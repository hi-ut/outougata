        "While such posts have often been associated with developments at the Heian court, in fact the first such were created in 702, and many others were instituted during the Nara period. Huge construction departments and service organizations like ZōTōdaijishi and the Shibichūdai were extracodal, as were the new guard agencies created for security at the Nara palace and such posts as the prince-liaison (chidaijōkanji), middle counselors (chūnagon), and advisors (sangi) on the Council of State.
