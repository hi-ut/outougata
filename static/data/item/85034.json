        "Bannermen.Both bannermen and household retainers (gokenin) were under the direct command of the shogun. Both had an assessed income of less than 10,000 koku of rice, but hatamoto were occasionally granted an audience with the shogun whereas gokenin were not. In 1722 the total number of bannermen stood at 5,205; household retainers numbered 17,399.［御家人, 将軍, 石］"
