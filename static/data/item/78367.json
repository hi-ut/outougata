        "The annual festival of the two Kamo Shrines (Upper Kamo and Lower Kamo) along the Kamo River, to the north of the city.  It was held on the middle day of the Bird in the fourth month.  On that day a grand procession went from the palace to call at both shrines, providing a brilliant spectacle for the people at large.  It was also known as the Aoi Festival because for the occasion people decked their headdresses, carriages, and so on with aoi leaves (see “heart-to-heart”), sacred to Kamo.  There was in addition a Special Kamo Festival (Kamo no Rinji Matsuri) on the last day of the Bird in the eleventh month; some of the Eastern Dances were performed for the deity by the palace musicians, and the rehearsal was held in the palace.[賀茂、葵、賀茂臨時祭][RK]"
