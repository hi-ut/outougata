        "A historical chronicle in seventeen volumes, beginning with the birth of Go-Toba in 1180 and ending with the return of Emperor Go-Daigo to Kyoto in 1333. Written in the simplified kana syllabary, perhaps for a more general population, by an unknown author in the late fourteenth century, it offers insights into noble society in Kyoto."
