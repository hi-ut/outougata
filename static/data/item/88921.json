        "Also known as Miidera, Onjoji was established southeast of Mt. Hiei facing Lake Biwa in the early 670s by Emperor Tenji. After being destroyed in the Jinshin War of 671-672, the Otomo family rebuilt the temple between 680 and 686, renaming it Onjoji soon afterwards. The fourth Tendai head abbot, Enchin, received this temple as a donation in 862, and it was probably made into a Tendai detached cloister (betsuin) some four years later. The Onjoji compound, located away from the main temple building on Mt. Hiei, became the center for Enchin's religious lineage, challenging for the sect's leadership from 993, when Onjoji was organizationally separated from the rest of the Tendai clergy."
