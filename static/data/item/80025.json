        "Daijō'e (J.) 大嘗會, also pronounced Ōnie-e, and referred to as 大嘗祭 Daijōsai/Ōnie-no-matsuri. Technically the first harvest festival (新嘗祭 niinamesai) after the sokui accession, the Daijō'e constituted a 2nd accession rite or, more precisely, a succession ceremony, and was followed by a series of offering to shrines throughout the realm."
