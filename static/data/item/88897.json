        "Completed in 1020 under the patronage of Fujiwara no Michinaga, this Buddhist temple became an important stronghold in Kyoto for the Fujiwara in the Kamakura era. Following the destruction of the Kangakuin in a great fire in Kyoto in 1177, Hojoji became the new Fujiwara administrative headquarters in the capital, until it, too, was destroyed in 1317."
