        "Another name for hototogisu, a tiny, bluish-gray cuckoo with a distinctive melodic call, which comes to Japan from the south around May and remains until August or September.  The term is also explained as deriving from the sound of the bird's song or as meaning lord of the fields [taosa] of the underworld [shide]\" (pp. 457, 593). [ほととぎす（時鳥、杜鵑、郭公、子規、不如帰）]\""
