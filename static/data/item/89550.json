        "Since the victims frequently succumbed, the ailment, mentioned thirteen times in Eiga but never described in detail, is unlikely to have been the common cold, now called kaze.  Most scholars explain it as a general term for a wide range of disorders, both chronic and acute, that were predominantly ailments of the nervous system (lung, liver, and stomach trouble, paralysis, epilepsy, etc.), and that were believed to be caused by vapors entering the body.  Treatments included religious rites, medicines (such as steamed garlic or magnolia-bark tea), hot baths, and the dousing of part or all of the patient's body with water (p. 82n)."
