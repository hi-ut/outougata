        "The monk-lecturer or leader of an important ceremony. The title, which was originally granted by the national bureau in charge of clerics (the sōkō), was limited to six monks. Both scholars and non-scholar administrators of important temples seemed to have been honored with the title in Kamakura times.　[僧綱]"
