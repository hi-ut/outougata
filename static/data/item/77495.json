        "A double.\" This word designated those who were ordered by a higher authority to be handed over to another party, and subject to imprisonment, death, or release by their captors, in order to rectify a wrong that they, or their associates, had committed. An important mechanism for constraining feuds in an era where the state did not monopolize coercive violence.\""
