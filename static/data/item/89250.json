        "An ancient Shinto ceremony which constituted a harvest thanksgiving ritual in the course of which the Emperor offered to the gods, and also personally consumed, food and drink made of new grain--steamed rice, gruel, white wine\" (shiroki, a sweet wine), \"back wine\" (kuroki, wine mixed with ash), etc.  By far the most important Shinto ceremony staged at the Heian Court, the daijōsai entailed complicated preparations that began months in advance (p. 375).
