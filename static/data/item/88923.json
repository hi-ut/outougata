        "(912-985) One of the best known Tendai head abbots, Ryogen entered Enryakuji in 923 and settled at the Yokawa section. His close relationship with Fujiwara no Morosuke (908-960) made it possible for Ryogen to revive Yokawa and Enryakuji after a long period of decline. He became zasu at the mere age of fifty-four in 966 and managed to stabilize and consolidate the monastery's internal structures, in part by excluding competitors from Onjoji."
