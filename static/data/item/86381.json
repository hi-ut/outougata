        "A conflict between Fujiwara no Mototsune (836-891) and Emperor Uda on the latter's accession in 887. Mototsune expected to be reconfirmed as regent (kampaku), but an edict was drafted naming him ako (the title of an ancient Chinese regent), an attempt, he insisted, to deprive him of power. Because of Mototsune's influence, Uda was forced to rescind the edict and reappoint him as kampaku. Only after Mototsune's death was Uda able to free himself of Fujiwara regency government."
