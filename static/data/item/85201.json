        "The outcome of a series of discussions held between the Jimyōin and Daikakuji branches regarding future successions, which commenced in early 1317.  The agreement made in 1318 between Go-Fushimi and Go-Uda contained three provisions:  first, reign lengths would be limited to ten years; second, the principle of alternating succession would be respected; and, third, the immediate order of successon would be that directed by the bakufu (pp. 16-19).  [持明院統、大覚寺統、後伏見、後宇多] [HW]"
