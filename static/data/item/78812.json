        "An important duty of a lord or lady’s chaplain.  The chaplain remained in attendance through the night, in a room close to where his patron slept, so that the patron should enjoy while sleeping the beneficent influence of his prayers.  For the Emperor, priests performed this function in a small room (futama) separated from his pillow by a partition.[二間][RK]"
