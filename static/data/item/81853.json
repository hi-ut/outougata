        "A residential quarter for merchants and artisans(also read as machi); an officially defined administrative subdivision within a city; each chō was jointly responsible for certain self-administering functions, and each was represented by a neighborhood elder(machidoshiyori); a unit of land measurement, roughly 2.94 acres until Hideyoshi redefined it in 1594, making it equivalent to approximately 2.45 acres.
