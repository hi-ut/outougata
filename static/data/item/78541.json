        "A yin-yang (onmyōdō) deity who moved in a regular sixty-day cycle.  After sixteen days in the heavens, the deity descended to earth and circled the compass, spending five or six days in each of the eight compass directions.  One shunned (imu) travel in a direction thus “blocked” or “closed” (futagaru).  In “Hahakigi,” Genji’s intention of spending the night at his father-in-law’s violates this taboo, and he must “evade” (tagau) the closed direction by taking refuge elsewhere, in some other direction from his point of departure, the palace.[陰陽道、忌む、塞がる、箒木、源氏、違う][RK]"
