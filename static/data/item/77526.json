        "Written commendations, or documents of prase. These documents were first issued by generals fighting in 1333 to warriors who fought valiantly on their behalf, and were increasingly issued as the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries progressed. The recepients of these documents remained overwhelmingly tozama, although from the fifteenth century onward, some miuchi (or hikan 被官) of regional magnates (the shugo) received kanjō as well.　[外様、身内、守護]"
