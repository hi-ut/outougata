        "Ryōgen arranged the [Enryakuji] temple complex into three tō and sixteen tani (valleys\"), the basic configuration that remains today.  The three tō included Tōdō, Saitō, and Yokawa, administratively and artchitecturally separate entities that conformed to divisions in Mt. Hiei's topography.  The tō were further divided into five or six tani, each with its own financial arrangements, including the rights to its own estates.  In addition, more than 3,000 buildings of various sizes, purposes, and levels of sophistication filled the valleys of Mt. Hiei, clearly displaying the power and prestige Enryakuji had achieved by that time (pp. 21-22). [良源、延暦寺、谷、東堂、西塔、横川、比叡山] \""
