The woman’s train (mo) was a long, sheer, decorated piece of cloth pleated into a sash tied at the front, at the waist, over the gown (uchiki, uwagi) and under the Chinese jacket (karaginu).   A woman wore a train in service or on formal occasions to indicate a subservient position.[裾、下襲、束帯、裳、袿、上着][唐衣][RK]"
