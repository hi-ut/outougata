        "[Didactic tracts penned by] Nishikawa Joken aimed specifically at commoners.  As implied in the metaphor of the bag, [the work was] a miscellany of ethical and practical ideas that ranged from nature, politics, history, language, custom, infanticide, and even to diet, in regard to the baneful effects of consuming red meats and wines in the manner of Westeners (p. 630).  [西川如見]"
