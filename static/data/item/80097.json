        "Goji-sō (J.) 護持僧, also referred to as 御持僧, 夜居の僧, goji-sō, yoi no sō. Monks who performed nightly prayers in the Futama of the imperial residence (Seiryōden) and a variety of semi-regular esoteric rites on behalf of the health and welfare of the emperor. Saichō, when a naigu, was chosen as the first goji-sō in 797 by emperor Kanmu, and Kūai was the second, chosen by Saga in 810. After the early period, when only Enryakuji and Tōji abbots were chosen, the post came to be divided between monks of Enryakuji, Onjōji, and Tōji, and though only one monk at a time held the position originally, by the 12th c., 7-8 monks contemporaneously served. By the medieval era, the same term was used to refer to monks who prayed in the sleeping quarters of aristocrats."
