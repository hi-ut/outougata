        "Above Shūzan, villagers maintained elaborate wooden dams (iseki)... to divert water to rice paddies.  An overflow gate with a spillway wide enough (two ken or twelve feet) to accommodate log rafts surmounted each dam, but when farmers were irrigating, they scheduled the opening and closing of gates according to local water needs and village agreements.  Any raftsman wanting to use the river then had to time his movements to coincide with these maneuvers.  When the overflow gate was not in use, rafts slipped over the dam and down the spillway (called a raft chute or ikada suberi) with the overflow.  At times of especially low water, raftsmen sometimes closed a gate, raising water level upstream sufficiently to float stranded wood into the holding pool.  Then they knocked the gate open to create a head of water that could flush along (teppō nagashi) any rafts aligned behind the gate or stranded below the dam (p.80). [周山、間、筏滑り、鉄砲流し]"
