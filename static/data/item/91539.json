When used of domains, there were two types of kokudaka: (1) the official valuation for purposes of record by the Bakufu, usually a 16th-or  17th-century figure (known as hondaka, original\" assessment, or omotedaka, \"public\" assessment); and (2) the tax collector's valuation, which took some account of subsequent changes (known as jitsudaka, \"true\" assessment, uchidaka, \"private\" assessment, or kusadaka, \"total\" assessment).\""
