        "A land steward, or one who was invested with the office of jitō in the aftermath of the Genpei wars (1180-85) by Yoritomo. Possessing powers of taxation and policing, this post proved most desirable for provincials, for they could only be dismissed by orders of the Kamakura bakufu. By contrast, local managers (gesu) could be terminated by the proprietor of an estate (see akutō). This office continued to be granted throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but it became amalgamated with the social category of gokenin during the fourteenth century. After the destruction of  Kamakura, this term lost its original meaning, but it still became associated with powers of local ownership, and possession of land. Jitō were increasingly referred to as tozama or kokujin as the fourteenth century progressed. [源平合戦、源頼朝、下司、悪党、御家人、外様、国人]"
