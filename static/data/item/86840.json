        "(1755-1817) [Confucian scholar.] A high-ranking domainal samurai of ministerial rank, Seiryō declassed himself from the aristocracy and sought intellectual refuge in Osaka and west-central Japan among merchants and enterprising peasants....  Seiryō journeyed among the commoners in search of a new principle that might explain more objectively the meaning of history as it appeared before him.  He rejected ancient models of genesis and drew on Shundai's perception of the crucial significance of trade or, more fundamentally, the principle of economic exchange, agreeing with him that land alone could no longer sustain society (pp. 646-7).  [太宰春台]"
