        "Sk.  Ullambana.  A Buddhist service held on the 15th day of the Seventh month for the repose of the deceased.  According to the Ullambana Sutra (うらぼんぎょう盂蘭盆経）, it is said to have begun by Mokuren (Sk. Maudalyāna), a disciple of Buddha, who wished to save his mother from the realm of the hungry ghosts (がきどう餓鬼道）."
