        "Gokurakuji (J.) 極楽寺, also referred to as 霊鷲山感応院 Ryōjusen kan'ōin. Originally located in Fujisawa, this temple was established in 1259 when Hōjō Shigetoki invited Shingon Ritsu monk Ninshō to found it. The temple enjoyed the ongoing patronage of the Hōjō for decades, and grew to include a large compound including 49 chapels as well as sanatoria, but with the political changes of the 14th century--especially a fire set by enemy troops in 1334--it fell into gradual decline. The temple held images of Fudō (Heian era), a Seiryōji-style ﾚākyamuni, and the 10 great arhats, a large collection of manuscripts and implements, as well as the tombs of Shigetoki and Ninshō."
