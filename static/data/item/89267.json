        "Because the island of Kyushu was both remote from the capital and close to the Asiatic continent, a special government office, the Dazaifu, was maintained in what is now Fukuoka-ken, charged primarily with defensive measures and diplomatic relations vis-à-vis Korea, but responsible also for education, taxes, justice, police work, relations with religious institutions, the supervision of commerce, and other aspects of local administration (p. 823) [福岡県]"
