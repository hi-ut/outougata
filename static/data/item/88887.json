        "A Buddhist hall that was originally built within Go-Shirakawa's Rokujo mansion in the southeastern part of Kyoto. It became quite wealthy in the Kamakura period, as it received numerous estates, becoming one of the main assets for the Jimyoin (Senior) Line of the imperial family. The Chokodo was the main target for Kofukuji protests in Kyoto in the fourteenth century."
