        "The three annual lecture-rituals, performed for the imperial court and the welfare of the state. They were the Yuima'e held at Kofukuji, the Saisho'e at Yakushiji (both located in Nara), and the Gosai'e at the imperial palace, largely controlled by the Fujiwara chieftain. Participation in and performance of these ceremonies were also crucial for determining promotion of monks to the Office of Monastic Affairs (the sogo), which determined the ranking of clerics in the religious hierarchy. The Sandai'e were also referred to as sanne\" and \"nankyo/nanto san'e\" (the Three Meetings of the Southern Capital).\""
