        "(One of the two types of recluse poetry).  This pastoral poetry is usually associated with the fifth century poet Tao Qian 陶潜　（365-427） and deals with the recluse who has retired from official service, sometimes of his own free will but more often as an exile, and who now lives on his farm.  The setting is rural and the poem expresses the harmony between man and his surroundings.  This harmony, however, often masks a frustration over thwarted political ambitions. [Ch. tianyuan, J. den'en] [HW]"
