        "Except with special authorization, only ladies-in-waiting of the upper class were entitled to wear the so-called forbidden colors, which in Michinaga's day seems to have been a term referring not only to colors, but also to fabrics and ornamentation-namely to red and green bombycine jackets and to stenciled trains (p. 225n)."
