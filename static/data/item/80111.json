        "Goshiki ito (J.) 五色糸, also referred to as 金剛線, 壇線, 五色修多羅 kongōsen, dansen, goshiki ito shutara . String of the 5 Buddhist colors (blue, yellow, red, white and black). The term here refers to the string which is attached to the pillars at each corner of the altar in esoteric rites. More generally, it refers to the string given by masters to their disciples at the consecration rite, which each disciple is to wear over his left shoulder. In either case, the 5 colors symbolize the 5 forms of enlightened wisdom (五智 gochi) in esoteric Buddhism: absolute wisdom, perfectively reflective wisdom, wisdom of the equality of all existence, wisdom of wondrous discernment, and wisdom to metamorphose on behalf of beings."
