        "the Eight-island Land,\" a designation for the realm of the Great King by the turn of the eighth century. It appears earliest in the Kojiki and Nihon shoki. Some scholars have argued that the number eight simply meant myriad, or that it may have referred as well to the eight, meaning all, directions. In any event, the appellation signified the conception of the all-encompassing realm of a universal monarch. [古事記、日本書紀] \""
