        "Fire-huts were used wherever an Emperor, Empress, Crown Prince, Ise Virgin, Retired Emperor, or Imperial Lady was in residence.  They were small portable structures where members of the guards or other functionaries kept fires burning on moonless nights.  Scattered references indicate that their basic purpose was to provide illumination, but little else is known about them (p. 225n). [Also 火焚屋、 火炬屋]"
