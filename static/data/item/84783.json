        "The northern lineage of Fuhito's descendants sired by Fujiwara Fusasaki (681-737), Fuhito's second son. Fujiwara Fuhito (659-720), who was Kamatari's grandson, had four sons, each of whom founded a separate lineage. The lineages are known as the Nanke, Hokke, Shikike, and Kyōke. Until late in the Nara period, members of the first two were privileged with the highest ranks and posts. [藤原不比等、藤原房前、藤原鎌足、南家、北家、式家、京家]"
