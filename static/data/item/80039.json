        "Eison (J.) 叡尊, also pronounced Eizon, and called 思円 Shien, with posthumous name 興正菩薩 Kōshō bosatsu. Originally studying esoteric Buddhism at Daigoji and Mount Kōya, and having received consecration by Jōkei at Kōfukuji, Eison became convinced of the need to revive the precepts tradition at the Nara temple Saidaiji, so in 1235 he took residence there. Later, he and others of like mind went to Tōdaiji to study the precepts and the other Buddhist schools further. Eison then spent many years teaching about and conferring the precepts at the temples Kairyūji, Saidaiji, Gakuanji, and Hokkeji. Eison's reputation was so great that he was called upon to variously preach about or confer the precepts on four retired emperors, and performed rituals on belf of the court to subjugate the Mongols. Eison was especially known for his efforts late in life to conduct assemblies to confer the precepts on and otherwise aid the suffering and outcast as well as to engage in activities such as the rebuilding of bridges, hearkening back to the actions of Gyōki in the 8th c., who also undertake the works of a bodhisattva. Eison also innovated by establishing reputedly 1350 sites where the taking of any life was prohibited."
