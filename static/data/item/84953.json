        "A senior prince who served as lieutenant to the Yamato king and whose headship of a royal lineage gave him and his heirs strong credentials as potential heirs to the throne. When the term came into parlance is not clear, but it is used to refer to Shōtoku Taishi in Suiko's age. The senior prince generally exercised plenary royal powers (banki). Later, in the ritsuryō period, the crown prince was called kōtaishi 皇太子 or taishi. [聖徳太子、推古、万機、律令]"
