        "Literally, original officer legacy.\" Used to connote inherited land rights and the customary procedures limiting them. Occasionally refers to a \"successor\" himself. Appears in many contexts, but especially in Kamakura's judicial edicts, which commonly order wayward jitō to \"follow honshi no ato.\" Often the term ato is used alone.　[地頭]　\""
