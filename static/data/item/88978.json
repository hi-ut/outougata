        "A detailed Tendai work that chronicles various monk appointments, ceremonies, and procedures of the Shoren'in in 130 parts. It was authored by the princely monk Son'en, about whom unfortunately very little is known. The original chronicle covers Tendai from the late twelfth to the early fifteenth century, when it was probably authored. More sections were added in the Tokugawa era by other princely monks. Since the work lacks a chronological structure and an index, it is somewhat inconvenient to use."
