        "These temples for the pacification of the nation\" were established by the Ashikagas in apparently every province of the realm together with rishōtō reliquaries between the 1338 and 1350. Unlike the rishōtō, which were usually constructed at Tendai, Shingon or temples of other schools of \"old\" Buddhism, the ankokuji were Zen institutions. See Rishōtō.\""
