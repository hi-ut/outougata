        "Account of the inventories and distributions of Tōji relics which usually followed the conclusion of the Latter Seven-Day Rite, compiled between 950 and 1368. The same inventory and record are noted, albeit under slightly different names, in works such as Kakuzen shō and Go-shichinichi shonikki."
