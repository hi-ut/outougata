        "One of the three major forms of warrior documents, gechijō occupied a level of formality less than the edict (kudashibumi) but greater that that of the communique (migyōsho). Gechijō were increasingly used in the thirteeth century, and became the dominant vehicle for judicial decisions, which were signed during the Kamakura era by the shikken and co-signer, or officials of the Rokuhara or Chinzei tandai. Under early Ashikaga rule, the shōgun Takauji preferred issuing investitures in the kudashibumi format, while his brother Tadayoshi, continued the Kamakura tradition of adjudicating cases with gechijō. Shitsuji and kanrei in the Ashikaga bakufu also issued such documents, but they gradually fell out of favor during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [下文、御教書、六波羅探題、鎮西探題、足利尊氏、足利直義、執事、管領]"
