        "(r.  1651-80) The fourth shogun, being a minor when he was named shogun, was obliged to rely on advisers assigned from among the high-ranking members of the Tokugawa vassal bhand.  This was the first appearance of a pattern of bakufu politics in which members of the fudai daimyo, that is, the hereditary house diamyo, exerted superior influence on bakufu policty through the Senior Council (p. 20).
