        "See also sangō. Generally speaking, the law of moral causality by virtue of which there is retribution for every action: good effects from good acts, bad effects from bad, especially re-birth in the Three Evil Paths (san'akudō; see under rokudō). A more subtle argument proposes that even good\" action, to the extent that we are aware of and attached to it as such, must ultimately be avoided as well as obviously bad action. Note, for example, S&P 5A: 5, as well as Shinran's famous axiom: \"Even a good person is born in the Pure Land, how much more so is an evil person\" (Tannishō 3). [三業、三悪道、六道、親鸞、歎異抄]\""
