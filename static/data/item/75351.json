        "Imperial lineage descended from Kameyama, son of the Go-Saga emperor. As a result of a succession dispute, alternated on the throne with Jimyo'in emperors during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. Ultimately, Daikakuji emperors became the Southern Court rulers; while rival Jimyoin descendants governed the Northern Court. Notable Daikakuji lineage emperors included Go-Uda and Go-Daigo. See also Jimyo'in."
