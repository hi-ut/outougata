        "Go-Daigo (tennō) (J.) 後醍醐(天皇), personal name of 尊治 Takaharu. This sovereign, the son of Go-Uda (r. 1274-87), became emperor in 1318 and tried to revive imperial government by reestablishing the imperial (estate) records bureau (記録所 kirokusho) and sponsoring attempted coups against the Kamakura shogunate, only succeeding in a restoration of imperial government in 1333. However, the restoration failed within 2 years, and Go-Daigo was compelled by Ashikaga Takauji to hand over the regalia to Kōmyō tennō of the new northern dynasty in 1336, though he immediately retreated to Yoshino to establish a southern dynasty, making Go-Murakami the next sovereign of the southern line in the year of his death, 1339."
