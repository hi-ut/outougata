        "Fujiwara no Mototsune (J.) 藤原基経, commonly known as 堀河太政大臣 Horikawa daijō daijin; posthumous name 昭宣公 Shōsenkō and, later, 越前公 Echizenkō. This powerful aristocrat managed to increase the power the northern Fujiwaras through purging the court of other families involved in a gate-burning incident (ōtenmon no hen) in 866, thereafter rising to the position of minister of the right, followed by regent and prime minister. In 880, Mototsune became the first chancellor (kanpaku) ever, and he was also responsible for the compilation of the court history Montoku jitsuroku."
