        "The early modern experience of another Kyoto commercial group, the textile manufacturers of Nishijin, offers a successful contrast to that of the brewer-lenders. Originally weaver-craftsmen to the imperial government in the Heian period, they reorganized themselves as a build when the ancient order declined. The otoneri guild in the medieval period were clients mostly of aristocritic houses like the Madenokoji and the shrines of Gion and Kasuga. [西陣　万里小路　祇園社　春日社]"
