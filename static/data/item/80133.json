        "The era in which the imperial capital was Heian-kyō (present-day Kyoto), lasting from 794 to 1185, when the Kamakura shogunate dawned as the dominant govermental apparatus. At the same time, Kyoto continued as the imperial capital, and institutions such as the traditional imperial government and the retired emperor continued to have a substantial measure of power for a long time afterwards."
