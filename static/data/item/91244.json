        "The Bakufu's two commissioners for northern Japan. The posts became hereditary in the families of Kasai and Izawa, both appointed by Yoritomo soon after 1189. The Kasai took responsibility for superintending Kamakura vassals and maintaining public order; the Izawa (later surnamed Rusu) exercised general provincial administration.　［葛西、伊沢、留守]"
