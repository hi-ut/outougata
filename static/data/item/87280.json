        "Commissioned around 1637 by Sakai Tadakatsu, whom Iemitsu called his right hand,\" ...the scenes depicted in this pair of six-panel screens take place at multiple times throughout the year, and Iemitsu himself appears in several locations in the twelve panels. [T]he focal scene in the painting, the \"action\" taking place in the over-scale Edo Castle that occupies two of the central panels of the screen, and that dominates all of Edo, is the arrival of the Korean embassy of 1636 at the gates of Edo Castle.  The chosen moment is the arrival of Ambassador Im Kwang, his sedan chair being carried to the first brdige over the outer moat, approaching the Ōtemon, the main gate to the castle.  King Injo's presents to Iemitsu, tiger skins, leopard skins, falcons, and horses, a dozen-and-a-half types of \"tribute articles,\" as many considered them, were arrayed for all to see on the plaza between the Ōtemon and Sannomon gates, while dozens of members of Im's entourage lined the way to the castle, both along the public streets of Edo, and within the gates of the castle.
