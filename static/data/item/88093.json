        "pranidhāna. In a broad sense, the commitment of various buddhas and bodhisattvas made in earlier existences to save all sentient beings. Specifically, the forty-eight vows of the Buddha Amida who, as the Bodhisattva Dharmākara (Hōzō), promised birth (ōjō, q. v.) in his Pure Land of Supreme Bliss (gokuraku jōdo) to those who call upon his name (nembutsu, q. v.). These vows, recorded in the Muryōjukyō (Amitayus Sūtra; the Larger Pure land Sutra\", T. 360) are the basis for faith in the saving Other Power (tariki, q. v.) of Amida.
