        "A Buddhist sect of the Mahayana school that preached that all human beings had the potential for enlightenment. It is based primarily on the Lotus Sutra, which suggests that all beings have the ability to reach enlightenment after this life. Tendai was known in Japan before Saicho (766/7-822), but he has been credited with establishing it as a separate sect early in the ninth century with Enryakuji on Mt. Hiei as its headquarters. It incorporated esoteric rites, Zen, and the traditional rules for monks, becoming the most syncretic of all the Buddhist sects in Japan."
