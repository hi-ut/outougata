        "According to a late Heian source, plum-blossom incense (baika) was usually compounded of aloeswood, the operculum of the gastropod Rapana thomasiana, spikenard, sandalwood, clove, musk, a kind of amber or retinite, and an ingredient made by boiling the leaves and branches of the chan-t'ang (sentō), a South China tree said to resemble the sourpeel tangerine (Citrus deliciosa). The scent was supposed to suggest plum blossoms, and it was therefore particularly appropriate for use in the spring (p. 652f)."
