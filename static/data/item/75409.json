        "A complex political struggle initiating in 1350, pitting Ashikaga Takauji against his brother Tadayoshi. This rift within the Ashikaga regime allowed for Southern Court supporters, such as Kitabatake Chikafusa, to kidnap the Jimyo'in emperors and steal their regalia, thereby leading to an epistemological crisis."
