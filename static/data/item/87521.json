        "Shogunal deputies stationed at Rokuhara in southeastern Kyoto by the Kamakura bakufu to supervise the political, military, and judicial affairs of southwestern Japan. The post was established in 1221 and held concurrently by two men, both chosen from among the ranks of the Hōjō family. The last Rokuhara tandai were deposed by Ashikaga forces in 1333."
