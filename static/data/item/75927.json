        "Originally used in the Nara Period to refer to a military position with power over the Kinai, it is best known for the Heike government appointment created in Yōwa 1 (1181). The appointee was given martial power to pursue and punish rebel armies. This position was given to Taira no Munemori for the five Kinai provinces as well as Ōmi, Iga, Ise and Tanba. He was given command of all local bushi. (Heian jidaishi jiten). [畿内、平家、養和、平宗盛、近江、伊賀、伊勢、丹波、武士]"
