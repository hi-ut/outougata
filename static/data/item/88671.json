        "A contractual agreement between a central proprietor and an estate officer in which the latter assumed full responsibility for collecting and delivering the annual tax. In return, the proprietor agreed that his agents would not enter the estate. There were also hyakushō uke (compacts of this type with resident farmers) and shugo uke (accords with Muromachi-period shugo).　[守護請]↓During Muromachi times, ukesho were arranged between central owners and shugo (the term then became shugouke).<Mass, 1976>."
