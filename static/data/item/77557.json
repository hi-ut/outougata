        "Literally lord of the myō.\" Myō represented a unit of taxation. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, powerful hyakushō initially secured the right to assess taxes on particular lands. They became known as myōshu in order to create social space between themselves and their hyakushō brethren. With the creation of the gokenin order late in the twelfth century, tensions arose between members of these two categories. Myōshu sometimes refused to be called up by gokenin for guard duty in the thirteenth century, but both myōshu and gokenin became amalgamated into the tozama order once civil war broke out in the 1330s.
