        "After its creation early in the Heian period as a private secretariat for the Emperor, the strategically placed and influential Kurōdodokoro became involved in the transmission of Imperial Edicts, bypassed traditional channels, and eventually deprived the Lesser Counselors' Office of most of its functions.  In close daily contact with the Emperor, its members also usurped many of the prerogatives of the Central Affairs Ministry's Gentelment-in-waiting, and by the eleventh century they were supervising the tenjōbito, looking after the Imperial repasts and wardrobe, staging official functions, and in general dominating the scene in the Coutiers' Hall.  Their offices were in the Kyōshoden, a building immediately south of the sovereign's apartments in the Seiryōden (p. 817). [少納言局、中務省、殿上人、殿上間、校書殿、清涼殿]"
