        "Gyōki (J.)  行基, sometimes pronounced Gyōgi, and also called 行基菩薩 Gyoki bosatsu. Hossō monk who, partially through the influence of his teacher Dōshō, engaged in social works such as the constuction of bridges and the opening of ponds to help the populace. Although Gyōki's activities, which violated the 僧尼令 Sōniryō clerical rules in the Ritsuryō legal code, led to his initial suppression by the government, his ability to martial popular support led the emperor Shōmu to employ Gyōki as fundraiser for the construction of the great Vairocana Buddha of Tōdaiji in the 740s. He died in 749, greatly loved by many in the populace, and was believed by many to be a transformaton of the bodhisattva Monju."
