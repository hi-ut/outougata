        "The Kofukuji ryaku nendaiki was compiled into its current form in 1725 by the monk Shoen, abbot of the noble cloister Daijoin within Kofukuji, who appears to have recorded the section dating after 1576. The earlier parts are extrapolated from various sources, dating to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries."
