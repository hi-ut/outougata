        "The tenacity of traditionalism in mercantile activities expressed itself most vividly in the contemporary term yuisho, whose meaning ranged from lineage\" and \"legacy\" to \"historical precedent.\"  In its contemporary usage among merchants, yuisho contrasted with shingi (innovation) and implied a socially recognized tie between a merchant group and a particular market, marketing region, commodity, or, perhaps, transport route (p. 123).
