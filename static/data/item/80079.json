        "Gahō (J.) 我宝, also called 自性上人 Jishō shōnin. First training at Kōyasan 定光院 Jōkōin, Gahō moved to 槙尾山 Makiosan where he revived the temple 西明寺平等心王院 Saimyōji byōdōshinnō'in through the patronage of retired emperor Go-Uda. Go-Uda reputedly came to Saimyōji often and sponsored Gahō's collection of more than 200 boxes of scriptures and treatises (聖教 shōgyō). Gahō, indeed, wrote a lot of works, including voluminous works on Buddha  relics such as Dado hiketsu shō and 舎利講式鈔 Shari kōshiki shō (as yet to be put into printed form), and his work has never been the object of academic analysis."
