        "According to the Taihō Code, for every three adult males in a ko, or residential unit, one was to serve as a soldier (heishi) in the militia. The gundan was commanded by a colonel (gunki 郡毅) drawn from the local district chieftain stratum, but militia officers were not to serve contemporaneously as district chieftains. The gundan in each province comprised ten squads, each of which served ten-day rotating shifts. Existence of 27 militia centers has been confirmed, in the thirteen provinces of Yamato, Suruga, Sagami, Ōmi, Mutsu, Dewa, Echizen, Sado, Tajima, Aki, Nagato, Chikuzen, and Hizen.
