        "This term, virtuous government,\" stemmed from the belief that possession of particular lands was innate, and that transfers due to economic exchange or commendations and confiscations were somehow wrong and needed to be rectified. Kamakura issued its first tokusei edict in 1291. This process seems integrally related to the increasing sense of transcendent rights to land that arose late in the thirteenth century, coupled with the tensions caused by Kamakura's enforcement of administrative law (see Goseibai shikimoku and akutō). Tokusei edicts would be repeatedly enacted by the court, Kamakura, and the subsequent Ashikaga bakufu. During the fifteenth century the tokusei became more of a devise for extracting income for the Ashikaga than as a means of restoring \"innate\" rights to the land. [御成敗式目、悪党]\""
