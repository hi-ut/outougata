        "The chief of staff of the Muromachi bakufu from the time of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu's rule during the late fourteenth century. This post should be conceived as a deputy shōgun, and became the preserve of three Ashikaga collateral lineages--the Hosokawa, Hatakeyama, and Shiba. Ultimately the Hosokawa proved most durable, achieving dominance within the bakufu and even launching a successful coup d' etat against an Ashikaga shōgun in 1493. [足利義満、細川、畠山、斯波]"
