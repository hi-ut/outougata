        "The Umetsubo (“plum pavilion”) was a relatively long and narrow (east-west) pavilion near the centre of the inner palace compound.   A passageway (medō, north-south), divided it into two apartments, each of which consisted of a chamber and of aisle spaces on three sides.  Red and white blossoming plum trees grew beside it.[梅壺、馬道][RK]"
