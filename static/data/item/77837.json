        "Houses at the base of Mt. Hie where elderly monks lived.↓From the late Heian period aged or infirm monks were allowed to live at the more temperate base of the mountain in houses called satobo, each affiliated with a valley.\" Most of these were located in the vicinity of Sakamoto near Hie Shrine, and some became substantial structures, as even able-bodied monks, many of them with wives despite the Buddhist requisite of celibacy for monks, toop up residence in them and gathered their spiritual discipline and flesh-and-blood progeny around them (p. 63).\""
