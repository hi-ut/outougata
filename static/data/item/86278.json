        "Lesser samurai who served the shogun directly but could not have an audience with him. In the early Edo period, gokenin were all direct retainers of the shogun receiving less than 10,000 koku; but in the mid-Edo period, this class divided into the hatamoto (anyone receiving between 500 and 10,000 koku and granted an audience with the shogun) and the gokenin (who received less than 500 koku and were not granted an audience).　[石、旗本]"
