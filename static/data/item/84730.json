        "a palace agency created by the ritsuryo codes to manage the affairs of royal consorts under the authority of the Ministry of Central Affairs (Nakatsukasashō). In the early Nara period, since the Chūgūshiki looked after the affairs of Shōmu Tennō's mother, Fujiwara Miyako, a separate household office, the Kōgōgūshiki, was created for Queen-consort Kōmyō. This differentiation continued into the Heian period. [中務省、聖武天皇、藤原宮子、皇后宮史職、光明]"
