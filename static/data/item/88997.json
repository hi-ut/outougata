        "Composed in the late Kamakura period (perhaps in 1296), this picture scroll shows the many misdeeds caused by small demons (tengu) that were believed to inhabit the mountains. Many of the scenes are set at Enryakuji, Onjoji, Kofukuji, Koyasan, and Todaiji, which are heavily discredited in this work. The images must thus be analyzed with great caution, though they do reveal the growing opposition the established sects faced in the late Kamakura era."
