        "outer ranks, differentiated from regular inner ranks, nai'i 内位. Beginning with senior fifth rank down to the rank of junior initiate, there were twenty outer ranks. Rank fields (iden 位田) given to those with outer ranks were half those given to inner rankers, indicating a considerable disparity of status between the two sets of ranks."
