        "Fu-t'ien (Ch.) 福田. Notion of a religious field of merit\" that by virtue of its reception of appropriate planting produces fruits. The term applies to the Buddha or clerics of Buddhist community, who through receiving the gifts and other hospitalities as well as through teaching provide the lay community with the root of future happiness and enlightenment--merit. Belief in merit wass a substantial part of the reason that many lay believers provided elaborate financial and other support to the clrical community. By implication, relics of the Buddha, insofar as they constituted in Buddhist terms the continued presence of the founder in the temple or monastic compound, were seen as ideal fields of merit, since aside from scripture they provided for the only continued contact between the Buddha and the contemporary believer.\""
