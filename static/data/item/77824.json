        "[In the 13th century,] a burgeoning demand for credit was met by these merchants, primarily through the medium of coinage imported from China. Some started as storehouse keepers (mikura) for aristocratic families and gradually extended their activities to include moneylending (p. 37).  [Alternate writing: 御蔵]"
