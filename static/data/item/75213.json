        "Mutual containment of the ten realm: Each of the realms contains within itself the other nine, including the realm of the buddha. Accordingly, the realm of ma, too, contains in itself the realm of the buddha; residing in the realm of ma, therefore, does not deny one of the possibility of attaining buddhahood."
