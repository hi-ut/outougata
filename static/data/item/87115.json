        "Shoin refers to the writing table that was built into one wall of the room.  Later it became a general designation for the style of a house that had this feature.  This built-in desk, combined with the tokonoma (an alcove for decorative display) and the chigaidana (stepped decorative shelves) are usually considered basic to the shoin type of architecture (p. 668).
