        "Fujiwara no Michinaga (J.) 藤原道長, commonly known as 御堂関白 Midō kanpaku; religious names of 行観, 行覚 Gyōkan, Gyōkaku. This most powerful leader of the northern Fujiwara clan became not only regent (although called chancellor or kanpaku, he never held the position) but also managed through marriage politics to have 5 daughters marry 3 emperors, thereby gaining virtually complete control of the imperial government on behalf of the clan. He also left behind the lengthy dairy Midō kanpaku ki, was perhaps the model for the main character of The Tale of Genji (源氏物語 Genji monogatari), and was the most prominent figure depicted in historical tales such as 栄華物語 Eiga monogatari."
