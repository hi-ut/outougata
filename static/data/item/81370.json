        "The tax from taxable fields, called so, was legally 1.5 sheaves of unthreshed rice ears per tan, which was only 3 percent of the yield from a top-grade field, but perhaps 5 to 6 percent in the case of average land.  When the registered owner\" rented a field out, the so tax was always collected from the actual cultivator (p. 272). [反、段] \""
