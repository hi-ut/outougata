        "Bombycine (in the obsolete sense of silk fabric\") translates orimono, a term whose exact meaning is no longer understood.  The apparent morphology of the word suggests that its original sense was simply textile, but in the mid-Heian period it was customarily used to designate a particular category of silks that included, on the one hand, a rich fabric intermediate in cost between damask and brocate, and, on the other, a relatively modest unpatterned cloth.  Used without qualifiers, the word seems ordinarily to have referred to the more sumptuous fabric, which the available evidence suggests was a changeable damask...woven in a simple warp-faced twill with patterning in weft twill or weft floats (p. 140 n.).\""
