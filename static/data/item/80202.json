        "According to traditional accounts, the T'ang master Paichang Huai-hai (720-814; J. Haykujō Ekai) wrote th[is] first Zen code, and thus established the institutional independence of the Zen school in China.  Although no such document ever likely existed, most of the codes compiled from the Sung dynasty on refer to it as their basis (p. 88). [百丈懐海]"
