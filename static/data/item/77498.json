        "Protector priests represented a team of as many as eight esoteric specialists who were stationed in the palace from the eighth century onward. These priests prayed for the well-being of the emperor. Once the Ashikaga attained power in 1336, they had five gojisō pray for Ashikaga Takauji. [護持僧、足利尊氏]"
