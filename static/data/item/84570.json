        "[Ritual] Performed when the son of a high-ranking family reached the age of seven or eight. Ostensibly designed to show the child how to read, it was a purely symbolic event, during which the elaborately dressed young principal sat in silence while others repeated  a few words from the Chinese Classic of Filial Piety or some other suitable text."
