        "Twenty-one horses, in principle rare blue roans, led before the Emperor, the Retired Emperor, the senior imperial ladies, and the Heir Apparent on the seventh day of the first month.  The sight of them was held to be auspicious.  The horses really were blue roans up to Murakami’s reign (946-967), through the time covered in the tale, but thereafter they were white.  This was the only New Year observance retained when an Emperor was in mourning.  The custom was originally Chinese.[村上][RK]"
