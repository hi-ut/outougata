        "A Buddhist temple in Nara, Yamato-no-kuni.  One of the Shichi-dai-ji and Shi-dai-ji. It was first established by Shōtoku-Taishi in 617. Its site was changed in 639, at which time it was called the Kudaranoō-dera, being in Hirose-no-kōri, Yamato-no-kuni. In 678 it was renamed the Daikantai-ji, which was sometimes abbreviated to Daikan-ji. In 710 it was moved to Nara. In 745 its name was once more changed, this time to the Daian-ji. When referring to it in connection with the Tōdai-ji and the Saitai-ji, it was called the Nantai-ji. Professor Kuroita Katsumi states that the Daian-ji was erected in Nara in 729, which probably means that although it was officially moved to Nara in 710, the temple was not completed till 729.
