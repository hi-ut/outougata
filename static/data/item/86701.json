        "[One of the major historical works of the early Edo period] compiled under the auspices of the Mito domain, [it] employed the kiden style, consisting of annals, biographies, and treatises....  The Dai Nihon shi was begun in 1657 at the direction of Tokugawa Mitsukuni (1628-1700), the second lord of the Mito domain.  The work, in 397 volumes, was completed only in 1906 (p. 409).
