        "a scriptorium at which Buddhist sutras and secular texts were copied. An early royal scriptorium existed in Temmu's day, and in the eighth century both the Queen-consort's Household Agency and the Tōdaiji Construction Agency had such copying centers, where large number of texts were copied for distribution throughout the realm. Recent research has also demonstrated the existence of scriptoria in aristocratic households, like that of the Northern (Hokke) Fujiwara. [天武、東大寺、藤原北家]"
