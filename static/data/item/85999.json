        "The standard gold coin issued by the shogunate, the koban (小判), was equivalent to one ryo in the early seventeenth century and contained almost exactly fifteen grams of gold, although it was periodically devalued thereafter; the shogunate fixed the exchange rate of 1 ryo of gold at 50 (later 60) monme (匁) of silver or 4 kan (貫) of copper coins (zeni 銭)."
