        "subjects of the tennō. The term came into use in the later seventh century, replacing the earlier hyakusei, or one-hundred names.\" Its earliest verifiable use is in an oral edict issued by Mommu Tennō in 697, who used the expression \"tenka no kōmin\" 天下の公民, the subjects of All Under Heaven. The character used to write kō, which might be alternatively translated as \"official\" or \"public,\" came into use in the seventh century to differentiate official affairs from matters of \"unofficial\" (watakushi 私) concern. [天皇、百姓、文武天皇] \""
