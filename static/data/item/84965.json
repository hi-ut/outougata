        "a royally recognized lineage. The <i>uji</i> was an extended kinship solidarity the structure of which is thought to have resembled a conical clan. Reception of a kabane title in return for services rendered to the Yamato Great King established the uji, which continued thereafter through the generations. The unity and status of the <i>uji</i> continued to be based on service to the Yamato king, along with devotion to the ancestor who established the lineage. By Tenji's era the Yamato Great King was confirming the heads of uji, known as <i>uji</i> no kami　氏上. Prominent <i>uji</i> included the Ōtomo, Mononobe, Soga, Abe, Nakatomi, and Fujiwara, but a total of 1,182 <i>uji</i> in the coalescent core (kinai) alone were listed in the Shinsenshōjiroku 新撰姓氏録(Register of Newly Selected Uji), compiled in the early ninth century.
