        "ajari, ajariya (阿闍梨耶).  According to the rules of Buddhist orders, the term refers to teachers of at least five levels; however, in the Shingon and Tendai schools, ajari is assigned generally to any monk who has received anointment (kanjō), and  daiajari (大阿闍梨) is assigned to a monk who has received the special anointment transmitting the teaching and rituals of esoteric Buddhism, denbō kanjō."
