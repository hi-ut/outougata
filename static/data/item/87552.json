        "Unit of cubic measure. In measuring rice in the medieval period (as the term is used in this volume), I shō of rice changed in real quantity from approximately 0.4 shō to 1 standard shō of the Tokugawa period, from approximately 0.722 liters to 1.805 liters. Because the square wooden container (masu) for measuring rice differed over time, by region, and even by shōen in the medieval period, the quantities indicated by koku, shō, and to in various chapters cannot be converted to Western measure or even Tokugawa measure with any degree of accuracy.　[升（ます）、石、斗]"
