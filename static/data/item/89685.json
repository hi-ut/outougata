        "Southern Palace. [E.g.,] of Reizeiin, of Higashisanjō Mansion, of Korechika's Nijō Mansion [p888]. [Of Reizeiin:] a residence associated with the names of Emperor Reizei's sons, Princes Okisada (Emperor Sanjō), Atsumichi, and Tametaka. It is thought by some commentators to have been part of Kaneie's Higashisanjō Mansion, and by others, including Matsumura, to have been part of the Reizeiin. (As indicated in Chapter I, n. 151n, the Reizeiin proper was destroyed by fire in 970 and not restored until 1008. It is conceivable, however, that some of its subsidiary buildings survived.) EMZ, I: 469; Cranston 1969, p. 294, n. 369; Nihon rekishi daijiten, 19: 177 [p166n]. [Of Korechika's Nijō Mansion:] Evidence from a contemporary diary suggests that this [minaminoin] was a residence in the southern part of the grounds occupied by Korechika's Nijō Mansion (south of Nijō Avenue and east of Machijiri). It should not be confused with the Minaminoin of the Reizeiin. EMZ, 3: 61 [p318n]. [Rel. 東三条殿＝ひがしさんじょうでん][冷泉院、東三条、藤原伊周 、二条、居貞（三条天皇）、敦道、為尊、兼家]"
