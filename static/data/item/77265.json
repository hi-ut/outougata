        "(718-770) The name Shōtoku refers to the second reign of Kōken Tennō (749-758), lasting from 764 to 770. Regnant Empress and Japan's forty-sixth and forty-eighth sovereign (emperor\"), she was born the second daughter of Emperor Shōmu to his wife Kōmyō. She appointed Fujiwara no Nakamaro and the priest Dōkyō to important posts, but then abdicated the throne to Emperor Junnin, only to re-ascend later as Empress Shōtoku.
