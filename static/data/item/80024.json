        "Daijō tennō (J.) 太上天皇, also referred to as 太上皇、上皇 Daijōkō, Jōkō. This term refers to the sovereign (tennō)--a word sometimes translated emperor\" which in any case was borrowed from the Chinese, and similarly suggests that the sovereign governs not only an empire but the cosmos as a whole--following his or her abdication. The first use of the term came with Jitō tennō's abdication in 697. Beginning with the tonsure of Uda Daijō tennō in 899, a retired sovereign who entered the Buddhist order was referred to as 太上法皇 daijō hō or simply hō. From the late 11th c. on, the retired emperor was in any case often referred to as 院 in.\""
