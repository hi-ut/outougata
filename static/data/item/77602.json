        "Literally an outsider,\" this term refers to warriors who were capable of behaving with autonomy, receiving their own petitions for reward, and fighting for whomever they pleased. Designates warriors otherwise known as myōshu or gokenin. Ultimately, the expenses of fourteenth-century war eroded their autonomy, and they too formed either ikki or became the direct retainers (hikan) of regional magnates, the daimyō (大名). See also miuchi. [名主、御家人、一揆、被官、身内]\""
