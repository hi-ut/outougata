        "The wrestling matches (sumai) in the Seventh Month provided entertainment for one of the great periodic Court banquests (sechie).  [Wrestling in Japan] appears to have developed in association with Shinto rituals, such as divination at the beginning of a new year to determine the probably nature of the harvest.  Scattered references in Nihon shoki suggest that by the sixth century wrestlers from the provinces were being brought in to entertain the Court, but such events were sporadic and followed no set pattern.  Sechie sumai is said to have begun in 737, when Emperor Shōmu ordered wrestlers to perform at the Tanabata Banquet, on the Seventh of the Seventh Month, as an adjunct to the main entertainment of the occasion, the composition of Chinese poetry.  By 793 it was a regual annual event--a celebration of physical prowess considered equal in importance to the archery ceremony (jarai) on the Seventeenth of the First Month and the mounted archery (umayumi) on the Fifth of the Fifth Month.  In the mid-Heian period, especially, it was one of the most lavish spectacles of the year.  It remained a part of the Court calendar until 1174 (p. 391). [日本書紀、聖武天皇、七夕、射礼、馬弓] [DL alt., すまいのせち （相撲節）]"
