        "Hiragesa (J.) 平袈裟, sometimes written as 素袈裟. Seven-part clerical robes of single color which were most often worn on the occasion of esoteric rituals. Those of higher ranking monks, in the case of Shingon, were often of orange-red tint (color made through incense-dyeing), while those of lower ranking monks were usually of white color. Hiragesa can be conrasted with 甲袈裟 kōgesa robes, which took a variety of colors depending on wearer and context."
