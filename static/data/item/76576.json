        "The Waterfall Gate was a gutter opening in the northern part of the eastern garden of the Seiryōden.  It was used as a place for a form of entertainment for nobles that involved varying the arrangement of stones so that the water falling over them would produce different sounds. There was also a guard post there, takiguchi no jin. [清涼殿、滝口陣]"
