        "alt., itsukinohimemiko) a princess-priestess, generally a close female relative of the Great King or tennō, who resided in Ise province to preside at regular rites at the Ise Shrine as emissary of the Yamato ruler. According to the eighth-century Nihon shoki, the first saiō may have arrived in Ise as early as the third or fourth century, but such late records may well be anachronistic. Close relations between Yamato and Ise certainly existed in the fourth century, but whether the saiō existed at that time is uncertain. By the late seventh century, however, the residence of the saiō in Ise and her performance of regular ritual duties at the shrine celebrated Ise's sun goddess Amaterasu as the royal ancestress.
