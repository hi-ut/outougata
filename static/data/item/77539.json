        "The act of surrendering, or one who surrenders (kōsannin). An easy act for tozama, it entailed unstringing one's bow, and presenting it to an opposing warrior. Customarily, one would lose half of one's lands in the advent of surrender, but this was observed more in the breach than in reality during most of the fourteenth century. [降参人、外様]"
