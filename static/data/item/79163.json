        "The design is created by applying wax to specific areas, dyeing, and then removing the wax, leaving the original background color under the resist areas. This can be repeated with new wax and different dye colors, though the background tends to grow darker and muddier with too many different dyes. Most rōkechi textiles in the Shōsō-in have been dyed once, twice, or occasionally, three times. [正倉院]"
