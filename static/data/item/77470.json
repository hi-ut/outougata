        "Evil bands or brigands. Akutō represents a pejorative term describing those who resorted to violence, often in defense of their judicial claims. This term carries no social connotations, and can refer to provincial magnates, tozama warriors, or their more humble followers who engaged in violence. (Most instances of akutō behavior arose with the upswing of judicial violence late in the thirteenth century, as the Kamakura bakufu began enforcing administrative law.)"
