        "(1212-?) The son of Kujo Michiie, Enjitsu was appointed head abbot of the Fujiwara clan temple in 1235 at age twenty-three but resigned later that year. He was reappointed in 1258 and headed Kofukuji until 1264, when his lack of support. of a protest lodged by the clergy led to violent confrontations and his deposition. He attempted a comeback with the help of armed supporters in 1266 but was beaten and managed to retire in the vicinity of Nara only with the help of his noble peers in Kyoto."
