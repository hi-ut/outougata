        "The diary of Fujiwara noTadazane (1078-1162), who served as clan chieftain from 1099 and as regent on several occasions. The diary that remains covers the years from 1098 to 1118. It is a valuable source for  the struggles of the chieftain during Shirakawa's years, but many entries disappointingly brief even regarding important events."
