        "Teh curtain-raising (tobariage or kenchō) was one of the dramatic moments in the pageantry attendant upon a great state event in the Daigokuden or Burakuin, such as an Accession Audience, a New Year Congratulations ceremony, or a Thanksgiving banquet.  When the Emperor entered the hall and ascended the throne, he was shielded from view by long-handled, Chinese style fans (sashiba), wielded by eighteen noblewomen (hatori nyoju) in magnificent ceremonial costumes.  After he was seated inside the throne curtains, two Imperial Princesses or other high-ranking Court ladies revealed him to the gaze of the assembled dignitaries by raising the south, or front, curtain (p. 140n).  [褰帳、翳、執翳女嬬] ↓Also 褰上 [HW]."
