        "A notable institute of Confucian learning based in eastern Japan and founded in 1439 by Uesugi Norizane.  [It] reached the peak of its eminence under its seventh head, the monk Kyūka, around 1550.  The number of students who gathered at the school during this period is said to have numbered three thousand.  From about 1560 the school was supported by the Go-Hōjō, the Sengoku daimyo who at that time controlled most of the Kanto region....  Most of the students were Zen priests, but their studies centered on Confucianism if not pure Chu Hsi thought (pp. 398-399). [上杉憲実、九華、後北条、戦国大名、関東、朱子学]"
