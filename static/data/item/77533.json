        "Laws established by the Ashikaga bakufu after ousting Go-Daigo in 1336. Modeled after the Goseibai Shikimoku, these codes justified Ashikaga rule, and provided mechanisms for the control over shugo and temples. During the mid-fourteenth century, these laws legitimated some recourse to judicial violence (see bōsen and kosen). Furthermore, the epochal hanzei edict was issued as an amendment to this code in 1351. Gradually, as Ashikaga power waned in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, these laws became directed toward economic regulations centered in the environs of the capital.
