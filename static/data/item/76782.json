        "the exercise of plenary governing authority by the Heavenly Sovereign (tennô 天皇). The original locus for such on a daily basis was the Throne Hall (Daigokuden 大極殿), with the monarch facing representatives of officialdom (hyakkan 百官) assembled in the Halls of State (Chôdôin 朝堂院, alt. Hasshôin 八省院). But such assemblies grew less frequent, and by the era of Kammu Tennô (r. 781-806) its locus moved to the Shishiiden (紫宸殿), which was the reception hall of the royal residence. In Heian times a relic of this practice was called shunsei 旬政, which was held seasonally either with the tennô participating, or by the senior nobles (kugyô 公卿) without the royal presence (in the latter case, it was termed “empty seated,” hiraza 平座)."
