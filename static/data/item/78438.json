        "Shutters or half-panel shutters made of square lattice-work backed by thin wood or paper; when down they acted as walls, particularly on the outside of buildings, but also sometimes between the chamber (moya) and the aisle (hisashi).  They were hung horizontally from the upper lintel beam (nageshi) and were lifted open and hooked up; or they could be removed entirely.  In some cases they folded in, as along the south side of the Emperor’s residence (Seiryōden), and in some cases they folded out, as they usually did when they bordered the veranda (sunoko).  Originally a single, hinged shutter panel filled the entire expanse between posts; later the half-panel shutter(hajitomi) filled the upper part, and a removable lattice panel (also kōshi) filled the lower part.[母屋、廂、長押、清涼殿、簀子、半蔀、格子][RK]"
