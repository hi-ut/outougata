        "Large-scale uprisings by followers of the Jōdo Shin sect of Buddhism in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. These uprisings were often led by local military lords (kokujin) who capitalized on the sect's tenets, which encouraged peasant solidarity and millenarian goals to advance their own interests.　[浄土真宗、国人]"
