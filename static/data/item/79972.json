        "Annen (安然), also called Godaiin daitoku (五大院大徳); posthumous name Akaku daishi (阿覚大師). In the latter half of the 9th century, Annen was one of three Tendai monks who most influenced the development of Tendai esotericism (台密 taimitsu).  Although unlike Ennin and Enchin Annen never succeeded in efforts to study T'ien-t'ai in China, he was broadly trained in both esoteric and exoteric teachings, and proved to be the greatest influence on the formulation of Tendai scriptural interpretation of the period."
