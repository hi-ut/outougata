        "A locality on the Uji River, south of the city.  The site of many country villas of the nobility, Uji nonetheless had a doleful literary reputation thanks to a celebrated poem (Kokinshū 983) by Kisen Hōshi, in which the poet played on the place name and on ushi, “hateful.”[宇治、古今集、喜撰法師、おん憂し][RK]"
