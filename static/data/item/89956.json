        "A result of an attempt to continue the National History series, undertaken in the mid-tenth century, resulted in the draft of a large work called Shinkokushi, but the text was never completed; and after 969, when the office in charge of the project was abolished, no more was heard of official historiography at the Imperial Court  (p. 6)."
