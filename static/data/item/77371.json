        "A metal alloy combing about 80% copper, 20%tin and some lead, sahari is yellowish gold in color and gives a beautiful ring when struck. The term sahari probably comes from Silla, but one explanation places its roots in Persia. Sahari is used to make various table dishes and Buddhist implements."
