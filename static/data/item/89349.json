        "Gotō no kiyomawari, performed semiannually by the Emperor during the first three days of the Third and Ninth Months.  The purification preceded the offering of lighted torches to the North Star, which was worshiped as a protective deity.  No official business could be transacted during the purification period (p. 266n)."
