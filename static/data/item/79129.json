        "Iron chimes. This instrument was made up of sixteen flat plate-chimes hung from a two-tiered frame, which would be struck with two sticks. The prototype for this instrument is the qing (J. kei, kin)  - a Western Han-dynasty Chinese instrument comprising sixteen bronze, upside-down V-shaped chimes suspended from a rack - which developed into this sixteen-plate hōkyō during the Tang dynasty. The hōkyō, like its predecessor, was most likely used for temple music. [磬]"
