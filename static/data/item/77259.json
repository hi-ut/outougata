        "Tanned deer or cow hide is molded to form a box shape, which is then hardened by coating it with lacquer. The lacquer can either be painted directly on the leather, or the box first lined with hemp and then painted with lacquer. Regardless of the method, the shape of the box incorporates a lid whose sides overlap the sides of the body (kabuse-buta zukuri). [被蓋造]"
