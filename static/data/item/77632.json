        "Kumihimo are braided cords made by interlacing bunches of threads in a repeated pattern. Because the threads are packed close by beating (uchi) down with a spatula, these cords are sometimes called uchihimo. Their names reflect the appearance of their cross sections: round (maru-uchi), flat (hira-uchi), and square (kaku-uchi). [打ち、丸打ち、平打ち、角打ち]"
