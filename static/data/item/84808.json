        "a deity, of which there are various categories. Most prominent are heavenly and earthly deities, a binary division adopted from China. Kami ni shimaseba\" is a phrase pronouncing the divine nature of the Yamato ruler that first appears in ↓Man'yōshū poems from the era of Temmu and Jitō. While translation is difficult, I render it (and the parallel expression kamunagara) \"being a deity.\" [万葉集、天武、持統] \""
