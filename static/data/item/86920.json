        "(1619-91) [Nakae Tōju's disciple] who served for a time as adviser to the daimyo of Okayama.  Adopting Tōju's advocacy of acting in accordance with time, place, and status,\" Banzan applied that principle to the actual conduct of government.  He criticized the growing trend toward autocracy in the politics of the day and tried to expand the possibilities for individuals to act autonomously.  Such views, however, made Banzan the object of suspicion, and bakufu officials ordered him to be kept under strict supervision, an order that remained in effect until the end of his life (p. 418).
