        "One of the three most important noble cloisters (monzeki) at Enryakuji. Also known as the Kajii or the Nashimoto monzeki, it was founded in the 1050s. Originally located in the Toto section, monks of the Sanzen'in were often involved in disputes over estates and the Tendai head abbot post with the Shoren'in clergy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries."
