        "A tale of love and adventure about an imperial messenger who, on his way to the source of the Yellow River, wanders into a Shangri-la of immortals where he is entertained by a maiden and her sister-in-law.  Although the text was lost at an early date in China, it had been imported to Japan by the mid-Nara period, and its ornate style was a major influence on Nara kanbun literature, Japanese texts composed in classical Chinese (p. 98).
