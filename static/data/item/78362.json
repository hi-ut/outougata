        "Rites to guide the soul towards a happy rebirth or, ultimately, towards rebirth in paradise.  They were held every seven days during the first forty-nine days after death, and at widening intervals thereafter.  New paintings of the principal Buddhist divinities involved were made for each service during the initial forty-nine day period.  During this period the spirit wandered in a “transitional state” (chūu), then went to its future rebirth, according to its karma, in one of the six realms of transmigration: celestial beings, humans, warring demons, beasts, starving ghosts, or hell.[中有][also掛盤][RK]"
