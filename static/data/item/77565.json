        "A long sword, otherwise known as a nodachi, or field sword,\" over three feet in length, which appearing first in the thirteenth century, and gaining great popularity in the fourteenth. Increasing to seven feet in length, these swords were ideally suited for the scattered battles of the Nanbokuchō era, but were replaced by pikes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as tactics shifted toward massed groups of infantrymen.
