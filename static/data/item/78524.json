        "A title borne in palace service by middle-ranking gentlewomen (fifth rank or above) or by the wives of gentlemen of those ranks.  Since a number of gentlewomen bore this title at the same time, people distinguished one from another by attaching to her title the name of the major office associated with her husband, father, or brother.
