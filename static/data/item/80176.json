        "Originally constructed by Fujiwara no Tadahira (880-949) and founded by the Tendai monk 尊意 Son'i (866-940), the abbotship of this temple was dominated by clerics of the lineage of Ennin, and regularly patronized by the Fujiwaras in the Heian and Kamakura eras. In the 12th c., Fujiwara no Tadamichi (1097-1164) took residence here following his tonsure, as did his son Kujō Kanezane (1149-1207) later."
