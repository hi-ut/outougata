        "Also Daibutsu Kaigen-e. The Consecration Ceremony of the Great Buddha, held on 9 April 752. The first ritual of its kind in Japan, it was conducted on command of Emperor Shōmu and Empress Kōmyō, its chief participants. In addition to the senior clergy who advised the imperial couple, this lavish ceremony was attended by one thousand priests and one hundred civil and military officials. Many of the objects used at the ritual are still kept in the Shōsō-in, including ornaments from the headdresses worn by of Emperor Shōmu and Empress Kōmyō; brushes, ink sticks, and silk ropes used for drawing in the pupils on the eyes of the Great Buddha; gigaku dance masks and dance costumes; ornaments; and objects donated by various nobility.
