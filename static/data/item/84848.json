        "The term appears in Chinese documents designating territorial political entities in third-century Wa. Kuni were later reported to have been the domains of kuni-no-miyatsuko in the sixth and seventh centuries. In the ritsuryō codes, the various provinces of the tennō's realm were called kuni. There were four categories based on wealth and population: great, large, medium and small. [国造、律令、天皇]"
