        "Often translated as surtax, additional rent, or cultivation fee; literally, an added rent\" paid by cultivators to those who acquired the right to collect such rents (kajishi-shiki). In addition to the rice tax (nengu) owed to either the shōen proprietor or the warrior overlord, this rent was paid to myōshu, religious institutions, moneylenders, and, at times, nobles who bought this right; see Taikō kenchi, myōshu, shiki.　[年貢、太閤検地、名主、識]\""
