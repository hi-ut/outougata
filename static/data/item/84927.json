        "interim rule by a senior prince or senior royal consort after the death of a monarch. According to the Nihon shoki, in the seventh century both Queen Uno and Prince Naka ruled for a time as regents before taking the throne. This interim system of rule was based on Chinese precedents. Should the Chinese monarch die while the designated heir was yet young, the heir succeeded but rule was overseen by a regent, generally the empressmother, until the new monarch reached adulthood. In the Japanese version, decision as to the ultimate inheritance of the throne was made during the regency. [日本書紀、皇后鵜野皇女（持統天皇）、中大兄皇太子（天智天皇）]"
