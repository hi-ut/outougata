        "The diary of Yoshida Tsunetoshi (1214-1276), who served as a mid-to high-ranking courtier (reaching the second highest rank) at the imperial court in Kyoto. The diary originally covered over four decades, from 1237 to 1276, in over 150 volumes, though extensive parts have been lost. It is particulary useful for the day-to-day operations at the court in the mid-Kamakura era."
