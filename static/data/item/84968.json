        "Gift-maidens sent to the Great King's palace by provincial allies and vassals in the pre-ritsuryō era. Uneme served as attendants in the palace by the fifth century, and they may well have had religious duties as well. This system of sending women to court was continued in Nara and early Heian times. [律令] ↓[HW: Also read うねべ.]"
