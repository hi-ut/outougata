        "In recent years, this scholarly concept has been elaborated by historians and archaeologists studying Yamato-centered kingship from the third through the late seventh centuries. Some researchers, especially Kadowaki Teiji and Mori Kōichi, have also posited the existence of regional kings (ō 王) who exercised authority (ken 権) beyond the coalescent core where Yamato monarchs presided as overkings\" (ōkimi).\""
