        "Hōbutsushū (J.) 宝物集, also referred to as 平判官康頼入道抄 Taira hankan Yasuyori nyūdō shō. Collection of tales, poems and quotations from Japanese and continental Buddhism compiled by the aristocrat Taira Yasuyori in order to demonstrate the fundamentals of Buddhism. The work is particularly useful for its insights into the Pure Land beliefs and nenbutsu practices of Tendai recluses of the late 12th and early 13th c. Although the work is said to have been compiled in 1178, several revisions were apparently made in the decades after, as 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 fascicle editions exist. The work bore an influence on famous pieces such as 方丈記 Hōjōki by 鴨長明 Kamo no chōmei (1155-1216) and the 13th c. warrior tale 平家物語 Heike monogatari."
