        "The meaning of pillow book\" (makura sōshi) is uncertain, but the term is commonly thought to have designated some kind of notebook. A sōshi (\"book\") was a stitched fascicule of paper, often with leaves in a variety of colors (p. 651n). [DL Alt. pron., まくらぞうし. Cf. まくらのそうし, the Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon.]\""
