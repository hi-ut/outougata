        "Generally abbreviated as shogun and customarily translated as barbarian-subduing generalissimo,\" this title was derived from ancient titles bestowed on government officials who led campaigns against insurgents or indigenous tribes on the periphery of the realm. The shogunal title, bestowed by the emperor, was resurrected after the Gempei War, and the shoguns became the military rulers whose governments (bakufu) ruled Japan with varying degrees of power, with authority held independently of that of the civil government.　[幕府]　\""
