        "[A]lthough part of the miyaza, mōto were inferior to regular villagers....  According to Nagahara Keiji, the mōto had two handicaps--the short duration of their residency and a low economic position.  They were recent immigrants who had not attained full social recognition as local figures, and they were agriculturalists ranking below the myōshu (p. 53).  [宮座、永原慶二、名主]"
