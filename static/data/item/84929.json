        "newly opened rice-field estates invested in by courtiers, official temples, or shrines. For such endeavors, cooperation from local elites, especially district chieftains, was needed. In the case of Tōdaiji's estates in Echizen and Etchū, members of the provincial headquarters as well as district chieftains aided in opening and management. Such estates were encouraged by the New Fields Law of 743. [東大寺、越前、越中]"
