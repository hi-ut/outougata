        "Daidan (大壇), abbreviated term for daimandaradan (大曼茶羅壇), and also called kegyōdan (華形壇). This great altar\" is the main locus of veneration in esoteric ritual. Commonly constructed of wood since Śubhakarasiṃha (637-735) introduced such an altar in Chinese Chen-yen Buddhism, the great altar is usually square in shape with dimensions of between 5 ft. 6 in. and 6 ft. 7 in., though altars as small as 3 ft. 8 in. square are sometimes used. The placement of objects on it varies slightly according to the lineage of practice. In Shingon, the objects offered on each side of the altar usually include water, powdered incense, rice, rice cakes, fruit, metal flower garlands, soup, sweets, and burnt incense. In the center, a wheel, stūpa, and vase were usually placed in the center, and a mandala would usually be hung in the rear, though on some occasions (such as consecrations) the mandala would be placed laterally on the altar, or images of Buddha and other figures in mandalas would be placed on the altar, creating a 3-D version.\""
