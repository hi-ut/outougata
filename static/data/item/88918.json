        "Noble cloister. Originally a term for sects or groups of disciples, but from the late Heian period it was used to refer to the special residential and temple areas of noble abbots, often located in the outskirts of Kyoto, where they could enjoy the benefits of aristocratic lifestyles. The monzeki were constructed in the popular shinden style of the Heian nobility with a Ushaped structure facing into a garden with a pond, instead of the more austere settings of the traditional Buddhist monasteries. The term also came to denote the noble abbot himself."
