        "Having no satisfactory English translation, it is well to leave it as much as possible in Japanese. In documents it appears as -shō,\" a suffix to a place name. Privately held, the shōen had a public aspect as the dominant unit of local land administration from the late Heian through early Muromachi periods. Shōen were held in proprietorship by a central, absentee overlord, but other local rights were simultaneously held at several levels. No single person could claim full possession of a shōen in a private sense.\""
