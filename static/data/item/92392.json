        "An important Shintō Deity (Kami) closely identified with war. Erroneously considered by some to be the spirit of Ōjin-Tennō. However, he, Jingō-Kōgō, Jimmu-Tennō and Hikohohodemi-no-Mikoto are generally worshiped at Shrines to Hachiman-no-Kami [Hachiman-gū]. Became a very important Deity when it was honored by the Seiwa-Genji as the God of War and worshiped as such by the famous generals of the Minamoto Clan. [神道、神、応仁天皇、神功皇后、神武天皇、彦火々出見尊、八幡宮、清和源氏、源]"
