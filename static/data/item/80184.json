        "Hua-yen ching (Ch.) 華厳経. One of the most influential Mahāyāna scriptures in East Asia, reputedly given by the Buddha in the first few weeks after his enlightenment, this work had several versions, and was the basis for the development of the Hua-yen (J. Kegon) school. The basic teaching of this school was that the highest teaching of the Buddha is that all dharmas  (constituent elements) of reality interpenetrate each other (一即一切一切即一 ichisoku issai, issai soku ichi). In Japan, Tōdaiji was the leading center of Kegon study since the mid-8th c., and featured the great Buddha image of Vairocana (J. Birushana), the Buddha centrally venerated in Huan-yen ching, who from a very different perspective is the main Buddha of esoteric Buddhism."
