        "Honchō seiki (J.) 本朝世紀, also called 史官記、外記日記 Shikan ki, Geki nikki. This lengthy historical record compiled by 藤原通憲 Fujiwara no Michinori (commonly called Shinzei; 1106-1159) at the request of retired emperor Toba as a supplement to the 6 national histories (rikkokushi) was originally much longer than its current 20-fascicle form. The extant manuscript covers the years 935 to 1153 (incompletely)."
