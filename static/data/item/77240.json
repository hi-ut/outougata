        "Glass containing lead oxide is very shiny and easy to shape. When lead (Pb) is heated and sand added to the lead oxide(Pb3O4), lead glass can be made from the resulting PbO and SiO2. If no impurities are mixed in, this produces a colorless transparent glass, but if a small amount of copper is added, the color becomes green, while a small amount of iron makes it yellow. The Repository has not only leaded glass fish and beads, but also yellowish-red lead pigment."
