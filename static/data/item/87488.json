        "A judicial organ established in the early Kamakura period of both the Kamakura and Muromachi bakufu that adjudicated land disputes and other property cases. It gradually became the chief judicial arm of the bakufu outside Kamakura. Under the Muromachi bakufu, most of the duties of the monchujō were taken over by the mandokoro, and the former became primarily a records office.　[政所]"
