        "Otherwise known as kandachime, kuge, or courtiers, this term refers to those possessing the highest three court ranks. This position hinged upon appointment to the court, and so should best be conceived as an rank rather than a class. Of course, some imperial princes, and members notable families possessed an advantage in receiving appointments making themselves kugyō. The Ashikaga tended to be associated as kugyō from the late fourteenth century onward. Conversely, with the onset of civil war in the 1330s, meny kugyō and imperial princes directed armies. [上達部、公家]"
