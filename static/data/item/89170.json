        "[Also Aomuma no sechie （白馬節会）, nanuka no sechie (七日節会）] Both because the horse was a yang animal and because green was the color of spring according to yin-yang cosmology, the Chinese sought to ward off illness during the year by viewing one or more green\" horses in early spring, preferably on the Seventh of the First Month, since both the day and the month were associated with the male principle.  During the eighth century the custom spread to Japan...As formalized in the early Heian period, the event centered around a ceremonious parade, viewed by the Emperor and a throng of other spectators, in which twenty-one horses from the Imperial Stables were led through the Burakuin court yeard (later, through the South Court of the Shishinden).  Afterward the Emperor and members of the Court banqueted while dances were performed (pp. 382-3). [豊楽院、紫宸殿] \""
