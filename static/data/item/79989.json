        "Bonten (梵天), also referred to as Bonranma (梵覧磨), Bonma (梵摩), Daibonten (大梵天王), Bontennō (梵天王), Bonnō (梵王), Shaba sekai shu (娑婆世界主), Seshuten (世主天), Bondōji (梵童子).  Sk. Brahmā.  Known in Brahmanical religion as the creator form of deity, in Japan he is especially known, together with Taishakuten (Sk.Indra) as a ruler of the heavens. Well-known early images of Bonten (invariably together with Taishakuten) are those in Tōdaiji Sangatsudō, Tōshōdaiji Kondō (8th c.) and Tōji Kōdō (9th c.).  Esoteric rites were sometimes performed in worship of him--particularly at Daigoji--from the 12th c. on."
