        "Gokai (J.) 五悔, sometimes pronounced go ge. These are the 5 confessions pronounced by esoteric adepts, and which correspond to half of the 10 vows proclaimed by Samantabhadra to be proper for all Buddhas and bodhisattvas in the Hua-yen ching. The 5 confessions are: resolution to devote oneself to the 3 jewels of Buddhism and thus purify all of one's actions; confess and repent all of one's trangressions of the past; rejoice at the planting of good roots by sentient beings; summon Buddhas to benefit and save beings; transfer the merit of one's actions to beings very realm."
