        "An outdoor sport. The playing field (kakari or maritsubo) was bounded by a cherry tree on the northeast, a willow on the southeast, a maple on the southwest, and a pine on the northwest; and four to eight players were distributed equally under the trees. The object was to pass the ball by foot from one tree to the next, avoiding branches and keeping the ball from touching the ground. The agemari, an expert player or someone of high rank, began the game from under the pine tree by kicking the ball to the players under another tree, who in turn passed it on. [上鞠]"
