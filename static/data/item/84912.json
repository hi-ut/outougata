        "an oral edict proclaimed before officialdom, generally from the Daigokuden. In the early eighth century proclamation of oral edicts played an important part in accession rites. Our earliest examples are archived in the Shoku nihongi and date from Mommu Tennō's age. Some fragmentary earlier examples of semmyō inscribed on mokkan have been uncovered as well.
