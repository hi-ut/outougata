        "This son of the powerful aristocrat 藤原兼通 Fujiwara no Kanemichi (925-77) rose to be minister of the left, and lost as a rival of his cousin Michinaga (966-1027) and Fujiwara no Sanesuke (957-1046) in marriage politics and other matters, dying at age of 78 in 1021. It was believed by many that after his death he became an evil spirit and cursed Michinaga."
