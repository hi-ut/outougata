        "The diary of Fujiwara (Kujo) no Kanezane (1149-1207), chieftain and regent in the early Kamakura era. By far the most important and comprehensive contemporary source for the years leading up to and following the Genpei War. The diary begins on 1164/10/17, when Kanezane was appointed to the second rank of the court hierarchy at the age of fifteen, and ends in 1203."
