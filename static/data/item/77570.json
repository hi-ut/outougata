        "Initially known only as yoroi, this term refers to the most expensive armor, which was worn with shoulder boards (sode), helmets and all other accoutrements. By far the most expensive armor, ōyoroi was suited for generals or other ranking individuals. This box-like armor was ideally suited for use on horseback and most effective in providing protection against arrows. Suits of ōyoroi open on the right side, but are supplemented with a special board to help fortify this vulnerable region. Gradually, as battles came to be fought on foot, ōyoroi came to resemble dōmaru. [鎧、袖、胴丸]"
