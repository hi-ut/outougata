        "[The Chōdōin (also Hassōin), stood] in the south center of the Greater Palace, separated by an open plaza from Suzakumon Gate.  [It] had been created to provide facilities for early morning deliberations in the Imperial presence, monthly reports to the sovereign by the assembled bureaucrats, Accession Audiences, New Year Congratulations, the reception of foreign envoys, and other occasions of moment (p. 836).
