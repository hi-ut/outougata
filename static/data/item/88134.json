        "Every variety of Buddhism would agree with Kūkai that the Dharma is beyond speech, but without speech it cannot be revealed. Suchness transcends forms, but without depending on forms it cannot be realized\" (Hakeda 1972, 145). Those methods of the Mahāyāna which emphasize \"speech\" (concepts, discursive reasoning, etc.) as Skillful Means (hōben, q. v.) are classified as exoteric, overt teachings (kengyō), as opposed to those which employ \"signs\" (shingon, mandara, q. v.; mudra, etc.) in order to intergrate the Three Actions (sangō, q. v.) of sentient beings with the Three Mysteries (\"Teaching-practices\"; sammitsu, tri-guhya) of Mahāvairocana (Dainichi Nyorai). Shingon's Tōmitsu is that sect's central practice; Tendai's Taimitsu is complemented by an exoteric component based on the teachings of the Lotus Sutra; and other sects frequently adapt rituals from these two major systems. Although esotericism is part of the Mahāyāna, Mujū sometimes speaks as if it were a separate tradition: \"The Hīnayāna (shōjō) had only the first three [of the five groups of the Buddha's teachings], the fourth is common to the Mahāyāna, and the fifth to the esoteric traditions (misshū)\".
