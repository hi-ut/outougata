        "Also known as kyōsha or otokodate, the kyōkaku were street knights,\" or self-appointed defenders of the commoners, whose \"chivalrous\" activities, gambling, and fighting were often prohibited by the bakufu. Samurai of the hatamoto and gokenin strata were the main participants in one kind of group, whose members were called hatamoto yakko; chonin formed yet other groups, whose members were known as machi yakko.［侠者、男伊達、幕府、侍、旗本、御家人、旗本奴、町人、町奴］\""
