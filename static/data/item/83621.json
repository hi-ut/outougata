        "Kūkai describes those extraordinary kings who have completed their moral cultivation in accordance with Buddhist precepts, those rulers who no longer need to be assisted by Confucian ethical philosophy, as cakravartin, the legendary universal monarchs of Buddhist literature, who, unlike scattered millet grain kings, reign over entire cosmic continents by means of their rule of the Dharma (p. 330).
