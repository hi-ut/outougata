        "First Day of Spring.  On the first day of spring, which usually fell near the beginning of the First Month, fresh water from a previously selected well was brought to the Seiryōden, where the Emperor drank of it, facing an auspicious direction and uttering a magical formula designed to reinforce its efficacy as a preventative of illness (p. 382).
