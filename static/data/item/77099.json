        "an annual tax register sent by a province to court to report taxes collected. It was carried by the shôzeichôshi 正税帳使 , and was one of four key documents (shido kumon 四度公文) sent by provincial authorities to the capital every year during Nara and early Heian times. Several examples are extant in the Shôsôin archives (Shôsôin monjo), including some registers from the eighth century. [正倉院文書]"
