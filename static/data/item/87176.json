        "Under the tera-uke, or temple register, system, all Japanese were obliged to adopt a family temple of registry (dannadera).  These temples in turn were given the task of making annual inquiries into the religious belief of their parishioners.  The practice of religious inspection (shūmon aratame) was then institutionalized by the creation in 1640 of a bakufu office for that purpose (p. 160). [旦那寺、宗門改め]"
