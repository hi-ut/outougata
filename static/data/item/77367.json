        "An ancient dyeing technique in which cloth is usually folded before being clamped between two boards with patterns of intaglio grooves carved into their interior surfaces. Dye runs through these grooves where it pools, thereby coloring only the pattern sections. This process can be repeated with different boards and different dyes to create complex multicolored designs."
