        "Face guards designed to protect the neck and lower face from arrow wounds, which were adopted as a result of the endemic warfare of the fourteenth century. Hōate replaced the hatsumuri (半首), gear that remained widely used throughout the thirteenth century, which covered the forehead and the sides of the face, but not the jaw and neck."
