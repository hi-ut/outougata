        "The blackening used for dyeing teeth (hagurome, also kane) was made by soaking iron filings in a liquid (variously identified as sake, tea, rice gruel, ect.) to oxidize the metal.  It was apparently used as a cosmetic by women from early Heian on, and by some men from the twelfth century on (p. 589). [Also 黒歯] [鉄漿（てつ）]"
