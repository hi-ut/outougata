        "The term may derive from miyadokoro, meaning the site of the palace.\" Miyako was certainly used in the eighth century; it appears in eighth-century poems in the Man'yōshū. It may have been used earlier. Perhaps retrospectively, it also appears in the so-called Taika Reform edicts. [宮所、万葉集、大化改新] \""
