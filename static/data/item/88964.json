        "An appointment record of high-ranking Onjoji monks, probably written around 1289. The author is not known, and four of the original ten volumes are lost. A good source for the platform disputes with Enryakuji and for Onjoji's relations with various patrons of the Minamoto,Taira, and Fujiwara. Like the Tendai zasuki, the Jimon kosoki is especially valuable for its full, and fairly reliable, quotes of lost edicts."
