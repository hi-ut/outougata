        "Fujiwara no Yorimichi (J.) 藤原頼通, commonly known as 宇治殿 Ujidono; religious name 蓮花覚 Rengekaku and, later, 寂覚 Jakkaku. The son of Michinaga (966-1241), Yorimichi rose to the positions of regent and chancellor under 3 successive emperors, and thus continued the successful domination of the court by the northern Fujiwaras. However, while he also accomplished the construction of the Byōdō'in at Uji, he was dejected over problems such as the inability of his daughter to give emperor Go-Reizei (r. 1045-68) a son, and decided to become a monk in 1072, and died at 84 in 1074."
