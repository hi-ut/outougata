        "Originally, the Shōgozō was the sutra repository for the Tōdai-ji sub-temple Sonshō-in. The building and its contents were moved onto the grounds of the Shōsō-in in 1894. It holds a wealth of valuable Buddhist scriptures that have a slightly different character than the rest of the Shōsō-in treasures. [東大寺、尊勝院]"
