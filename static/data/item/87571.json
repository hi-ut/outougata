        "Self-governing organizations that existed in rural Japan from the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries. Each sō took responsibility for its own irrigation, communal lands, law and order, and, in some cases, defense. Decisions were reached and carried out at group meetings (yoriai) made up of a headman and a small group of elders selected from among the leading landholders (myōshu); also called sō-mura.　[寄合、名主、惣村]"
