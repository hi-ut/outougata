        "One of the four civil service examinations.  Others were shūsai (flourishing talent\"), myōgyō (classics), and myōhō (law).  The shinshi examination consisted of two essay questions on \"the essential business of governing the nation\" and a test of the candidates' memorization of two Chinese texts--Wen-hsuan and Erh-ya, the former being the then popular literary anthology and the latter an early lexicographic work (p. 75).
