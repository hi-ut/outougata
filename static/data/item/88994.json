        "The diary of Fujiwara no Yorinaga (1120-1156), the son of Tadazane, who staged the failed coup in 1156 against Go-Shirakawa after having been promoted hastily by his father in opposition to his older brother, Tadamichi. Yorinaga was a highly respected scholar as well as an accomplished writer despite his youth. Most of the diary has been lost, but sporadic entries remain for the years 1136-1155."
