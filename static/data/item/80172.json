        "Hōshō (Butsu) (J.) 宝生（佛）, also called 羅怛曩三婆縛 Ratanōsanbaba. This Buddha (Sk. Ratnasambhava) is the southern among the 5 main Buddhas of the Diamond Realm mandala, and through his possession of the jewel implement has the capacity to rain down wish-fulfilling jewels on beings, representing the power of the Buddha to grant all wishes. He is also seen as being identical with the Buddhas Kaifuke-ō and Hōdō in the Womb Realm, as well as a series of other lesser known Buddhas."
