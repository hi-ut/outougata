        "Originally a function or office with attached perquisites; later the right to designated income (with or without duties) under title of an office.\" The bureaucratic (and therefore temporary) quality of shiki eventually gave way to one which was private and permanent, and the post often became hereditary. Several shiki holders might conjoinly \"possess\" an individual unit of land. (See Mass, Kamakura Bakufu) Thus a single piece of cultivable land had divided tenures and divided income rights attached to it. Each shiki included the power to administer at a specified level, and low-ranking shiki, such as the myōshu shiki, became salable in the Muromachi period. [名主職]　\""
