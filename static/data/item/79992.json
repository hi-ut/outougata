        "Bushi (武士), originally pronounced mononofu, and also referred to more generally as 侍 samurai (or saburai). These professional warriors rose to the pinnacle of political power with the development of the shogunate (幕府 bakufu) in the late 12th c., although multiple warrior groups continued to compete with each other, leading to repeated conflicts throughout the medieval and early modern eras."
