        "According to tradition they were descended from Hoderi-no-Mikoto and were therefore part of the Yamato race. However, most scholars consider Hayato to be a later name for the Kumaso who are believed to have come from the East Indies, Borneo in particular, although scholars are not agreed on their exact origin. Thus, the Hayato and the Kumaso are the same people and quite different from the  Yamato \" race.\""
