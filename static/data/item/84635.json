        "Like Ra[n]ryōō, the Chinese piece with which it was usually paired, the Korean Nassori was a classic fast dance. It was performed by two dancers, usually children, who wore blue-and-gold masks and flourished short batons. When performed by a single dancer, it was called Rakuson. [Can also be read Nasori\"] [蘭陵王、雅楽]\""
