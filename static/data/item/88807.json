        "Many of the leading prelates in the central monasteries of the older schools had come from Kyoto noble families and naturally made use of these social connections in the interests of their monasteries.  Through a system of imperial designation, certain monasteries and nunneries provided havens or imperial princes and princesses who wished to withdraw from the secular world, or for whom it was necessary to provide an office and income.  these were known as monzeki temples."
