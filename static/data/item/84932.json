        "A modern term denoting a chieftain, viewed by anthropologists as characteristic territorial leaders at the chiefdom stage of sociopolitical development. Historians in Japan argue that the prehistoric chieftain in the Yayoi and Kofun periods represented the chiefdom vis-à-vis outsiders-foreigners and the gods-and that such chiefly prerogatives gave the office great power while influencing subsequent political offices derived from it, for example, those of the tennō, ujinokami, and gunji. [弥生、古墳、天皇、氏上、郡司]"
