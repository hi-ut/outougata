        "Tendai temple in Nagoya near the Atsuta Shrine, founded as Momooji by Yamada Jirō Shigetada (1165-1221).  The temple came to beknown as Chōboji (Temple for the Eternal [Life] of the Mother [of Yamada Shigetada).  This became its official designation when Mujū took charge as abbot.  Mujū came to live at the temple in 1261 under abbot Jōgan Shōnin at the age of 35.  Shortly thereafter the temple buildings burned to the ground but were soon restored (pp. 35-37). ［天台、名古屋、熱田神宮、桃尾寺、山田次郎重忠]"
