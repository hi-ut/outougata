        "Hishō (J.) 秘鈔, sometimes pronounced Hisho. Large commentarial work on the esoteric rites of the Ono and Hirosawa branches of Shingon compiled by the prince-monk Shukaku hōshinnō (1150-1202). The work is an invaluable source for understanding esoteric Shingon ritual of the era, given that the knowledgeable Ono branch Daigoji ritualist Shōken (1138-96) helped him greatly with the compilation, and the fact that Shukaku, a disciple of Shōken, was also a Ninnaji monk who studied the Hirosawa materials extensively. The reader should note that several versions of the manuscript exist."
