        "Oil-coated or oil-painted decoration. On lacquer, it refers to designs painted from a paste made from colored pigments combined with a mixture of a drying oil, such as tung oil (Aleurites cordata; J., kiriabura) or perilla oil (Perilla ocymoides; J., enoabura), with lead oxide (PbO; J., mitsudasō) or a similar additive to serve as a desiccator. This term also encompasses the technique of applying an overall coating of oil to a painting executed in pigments mixed with animal-skin glue. The Japanese term mitsuda is thought come from a Chinese translation of a Persian word. [桐油、荏油、密陀僧]"
