The Ninnōkyō hō was first performed (on behalf of the government) by  Kai in 810, and thereafter was commonly practiced as a nation-protecting ritual. The godan hō was first performed at Hieizan in 961, and was first performed in the palace in 1065. Well-known images of the 5 awesome deities are kept in Tōji (9th c.) and Daikakuji (12th c.), and the tapestries of them in Tōji (12th c.) and Daigoji (Kamakura era)."
