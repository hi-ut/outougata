        "The Kamo Festival (held annually on the middle Day of the Cock in the Fourth Month) was one of the great religious and social events of the year, involving official and private preparations that began weeks in advance.  The Emperor and the Virgin performed purification rituals, dancers and musicians rehearsed, guards officers were assigned to special ceremonial watches, offerings were prepared, and costumes, carriages, and horse trappings of the utmost magnificence were assembled in every aristocratic household, either for use in the official ceremonies or to impress fellow spectators.
