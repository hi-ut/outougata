        "(alt., kokka) a term used to denote the tennō's realm and its governing apparatus in the seventh century. The term appears in the chapter concerning Temmu's reign in the Nihon shoki, but it may have been used earlier, since it appears in Prince Shōtoku's Seventeen Articles 十七条. Modern researchers also use the term kokka to denote a state formation. [天皇、天武、日本書紀、聖徳太子、国家]"
