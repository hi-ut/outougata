        "Genkai (J.) 元海, also called 松橋大僧都 Matsuhashi no daisōzu. Daigoji monk of the Sanbō'in in the Ono branch of Shingon known for his close ties to retired empress Bifukumon'in, his efforts to establish a collection of scriptures and treatises (shōgyō), as well as his knowledge and voluminous writings on esoteric ritual. Receiving denbō kanjō from Jōkai at Sanbō'in, Genkai rose to abbot of Daigoji and of Enkōin in its compound before becoming second abbot at Tōji in 1153. Genkai also established Matsuhashi muryōju'in, where he attempted to produce a collection of esoteric materials, and so he was simultaneously the leader of Sanbō'in and of Matsuhashi, handing over leadership respectively to the monks Jichiun and 一海 Ikkai (1116-79). Genkai's works include Atsuzōshi and 如法尊勝記 Nyohō sonshō ki, amng others."
