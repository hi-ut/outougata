        "Eun (J.) 恵運, also called 安祥寺僧都 Anjōji sōzu. Originally trained by the Tōdaiji monk Taiki and the Yakushiji monk Chūkei in the study of Mahāyāna scripture and Hossō treatises, Eun chose to enter the lineage of the Shingon monk 実慧 Jitsu'e (786-847), receiving consecration from him at Tōji. After copying the canon in eastern Japan based on an imperial order, he was appointed official lecturer of Chikuzen province and Kanzeonji temple in Kyushu. Eun used the occasion to board a boat on its way back to China in 842; arriving in Ch'ang-an, he studied esoteric Buddhism under I-chen at Ch'ing-lung ssu and received consecration, and afterward made pilgrimage to Mounts Wu-t'ai and T'ien-t'ai, returning to Japan in 847. Bringing back a large number of scriptures, treatises, and implements, he was ordered by the empress dowager to found the temple Anjōji in Yamashina in 848, and was later a preceptor for members of the imperial family."
