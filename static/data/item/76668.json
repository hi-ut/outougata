        "An architectural feature of palace structures, it was characterized by its sloped celing, and modular outside wall, a result of its being on the periphery of such core spaces as the moya of a building.  Its outer wall was comprised of two sections of latticed wood （kōshi）per bay, one attached by hinges to the celing, and the other resting in grooves in the floor.  The lower section could be completely removed, while the upper, when open, was suspended from the outer eaves by iron hooks.  When the outer walls of the East Eaves Porch were thus opened up, bamboo blinds (sudare) could be lowered in their place. [母屋、格子、簾]"
