        "A decoration hung around an altar area, the keman symbolizes flower bouquets presented to the Buddha. In Japan keman are made of metal, leather, beads, and wood. Generally shaped like the cross-section of a round apple, these flat pieces are decorated with designs of flowers and birds, and sometimes Buddhist-style Sanskrit characters. They have a real or depicted cord tied in a bow at the upper center."
