        "[Passim] Birth celebrations (ubuyashinai). Heian families held formal celebratory banquets, with poetry and music, on the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth nights after a child's birth.... Features of the evenings included the congratulatory visits of the Kangakuin students (Chapter 1, n.135), if the grandfather were the head of the Fujiwara house; the use of colored garments and furnishings on the Ninth Night, after the change from white (ironaoshi) that took place on the eighth day; and an ill-understood ceremony, the megurigayu or susurigayu, which was probably either a symbolic first feeding or an offering to ward off evil and ensure future prosperity. Nakamura 1962, pp.60-72 (p369). [産養、勧学院、色直し、啜粥]"
