        "Originally this term referred to natural precious stones found on the sacred Mount Sumeru. The most revered were the blue jewels. Later in China ruri\" came to refer to blue glass, and after that to glass in general. In the Shōsō-in there are objects called white ruri and green ruri, but they are almost all made from leaded glass, while the blue ruri are made from both alkali-lime glass and leaded glass. [須弥山、正倉院] \""
