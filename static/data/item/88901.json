        "(1218-?) The son of Kujo Michiie and the brother of shogun Kujo Yoritsune, Jigen became head abbot of Tendai in 1238 at the age of twenty. Jigen remained in Kyoto, involving himself in both religious and political matters. His failure to control the clergy induced him to resign in 1239, but he was  reappointed on 1241/1/17, remaining Tendai head until 1247, when he resigned again in protest of the ousting of his brother in Kamakura."
