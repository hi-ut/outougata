        "[Ihara] Saikaku's first book, [which] traces the progress of a rake, the son of a wealthy Kyoto merchant, from his precocious initiation through escapades with women of all classes in brothels throughout the country.  By the age of sixty, tiring of what Japan has to offer after encounters with 3,742 women and 725 young men, the rake sails off with his companions in search of the fabled Island of Women (p. 762). [井原西鶴]"
