        "These were government loans, often seed rice, made to peasants in Japan from the 7th through 12th centuries. Interest rates varied from 30 to 100 percent annually. The loans originated with the need to lend food and seed to peasants as relief in the spring and summer. Many peasants were forced to sell their lands to pay off their debts to private lenders who had given them private loans (shisuiko). The heavy burden of interest caused many peasants to abandon their land and flee to other districts. The government made repeated attempts to deal with this problem by prohibiting these private loans (shisuiko) and making government loans available to the peasants. [私出挙]"
