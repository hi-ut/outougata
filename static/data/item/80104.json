        "Gorin-tō (J.) 五輪塔, also referred to as 五輪卒塔婆, 五輪塔婆, 法界塔, 五解脱輪 gorin-sotoba, gorin-tōba, hokkai-tō, gogedatsurin. A stūpa of 5 sections, this reliquary was seen from medieval times on as an ideal form of tomb because it was comprised of 5 levels, each of which corresponded to one of the sanmaya forms of Dainichi as well as its representative sanskrit syllable. From bottom to top, the stones are as follows: square, earth, a; round, water, va; triangular, fire, ra; crescent-sphaped, wind, ha; jewel-shaped, space, kha. Together, these elements reproduce Dainichi, as the Dharma-body (法身 hosshin; i.e., absolute or cosmic body) of the Buddha, symbolizing the ideal body/form of the universe."
