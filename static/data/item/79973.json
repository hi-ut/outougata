        "Son of the shōgun Takauji, Motouji was sent by his father at the age of 10 to Kamakura to in 1350 to act as his father's representative in place of his older brother Yoshiakira, who was sent back to Kyoto. Motouji became the foster son of Takauji's brother Tadayoshi, but had to flee Kamakura when the brothers came into confrontation with each other; he returned upon supposed reconciliation in 1352, but with Tadayoshi's assassination by poisoning the next day, Motouji became caught up again in a power struggle, this time between his father and forces loyal to Tadayoshi.  After Takauji's death and Yoshiakira's assumption of the position of shōgun in 1358, Motouji thereafter attempted to avoid confrontation with his brother by taking his own force of samurai to act on behalf of the shogunate in other parts of Japan, only to die in an epidemic in 1367."
