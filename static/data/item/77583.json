        "Status-based rights of revenue. The distinction between these status-based rights withered in the fourteenth century as locals came ro possess shiki that had previously been reserved for courtly proprietors. Gradually, rights to the land began being conceived as being more unitary. See ando, shōen, and honryō. [安堵、荘園、本領]"
