        "Ejū (J.) 恵什, posthumous name of monk called variously 勝定, 信濃阿闍梨, 釈王寺入寺 Shōjō, Shinano ajari, Shakuōji nyūi, originally with posthumous name of 斉朝 Seichō. Shingon monk of the Ishiyama line of the Ono branch was apparently responsible for the compilation of the encyclopedic work Zuzō shō, in spite of earlier claims that the monk 永厳 Yōgen had done so."
