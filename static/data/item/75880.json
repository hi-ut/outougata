        "Also zaichō kannin. From the mid-Heian to the Kamakura Period, the zaichō kanjin were residential provincial officials who held managerial powers in provincial offices (kokuga) and followed the orders of the absentee provincial governor.  After the Heian Period, provincial governors were not sent to the countryside.  Instead they stayed in the capital and sent out representatives.  The place where these representatives and the residential provincial officials worked was called the Absentee Office (rusudokoro).  Many of the zaichō kanjin were local elites with strong ties to the area they managed.  The zaichō kanjin posts tended to become hereditary and in the Kamakura Period the positions stood in opposition to the gokenin (housemen) of the bakufu. [在庁官人、国衙、留守所、御家人、幕府]"
