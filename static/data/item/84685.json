        "Founded in 1061 by Minamoto Yoriyoshi as a branch of the Iwashimizu Hachiman Shrine, whose principal object of worship, the war god Hachiman, was the tutelary deity of the Minamoto clan. Originally located at Yuigahama, south of Kamakura, it was moved by Yoritomo in 1180 to its present site, in Yuki-no-shita, Kamakura, where it functioned as the protector of the shogunate.
