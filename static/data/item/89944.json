        "The Code had conceived of the Ministry of Ceremonial as a small but important organ in charge of procedures at Court ceremonies, responsible for the operation of the University (Daigaku), and actively invovled in evaluating the merits of officials.  In the mid-Heian period, however, considerations other than merit determined the success of a man's career; the University played only a minor role in Court life; and ceremonies, though numerous, were by no means the responsibility of the Shikibushō alone.  The ministry's duties do not appear to have been onerous (p. 808). [大学]"
