        "A weave structure comprising polychrome wefts and two different monochrome warps: a binding or foundation warp that forms the weave structure (usually twill) and a hidden secondary or pattern warp (usually double) that manipulates the weft movement and acts as a fill between the floating surface weft and all other wefts on the reverse at any given point. Weft-faced compound twills flourished in and after the Tang dynasty. Structurally, they are very similar to warp-faced compound twills when turned on a ninety-degree angle. However, this newer structure does not have the color constrictions of its warp-faced counterpart and thus allows for more color variety and larger-scale designs. Also read ikin."
