        "Zuhō (also suhō, shuhō, or shiho) were esoteric rituals celebrated by monks from leading Tendai and Shingon temples, in which the officiants made offerings of flowers, food, drink, incense, tapers, water, and the like; recited sutras, prayers, and incantations; performed magical hand gestures; made burnt offerings (goma; Skt. homa); and otherwise attempted to ensure prosperity, end a calamity, cure an illness, ensure the safe delivery of a child, or expel an evil spirit by achieving mystic unity with the buddhas or bodhisattvas enshrined on special alters erected for the sevices. Such rituals, and the elaborate preparations they entailed, played an important part in the lives of the Heian nobility. They varied in scale from small (one main alter combined with a fire alter, with one main officiant and ten or fewer assistants) through medium (two to four altars, each with an officiant and a maximum of sixteen assistants) to large (five or more altars, each with an officiant and from seventeen to twenty assistants); and the objects of worship, procedures, altar shapes, and offerings varied according to the ends sought (p372).
