        "The headquarters for the Shingi Shingon sect, located at Negoroji. The Daidenpoin was originally established as a cloister on Mt. Koya by Kakuban in 1130, but when Toba granted it special status and stated that the head of the cloister should also be the abbot of Kongobuji (Koyasan), new frictions emerged. Kakuban was driven off Mt. Koya, and the tensions continued for over a century until 1288, when the monk Raiyu moved the cloister to its present location at Negoroji, marking the establishment of the new Shingon sect."
