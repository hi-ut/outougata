        "A narrative poem by Bai Juyi (772-846), extremely popular in Heian Japan.  It tells the story of the love of the Tang Chinese Emperor Xuanzong for Yang Gueifei (J. Yōkihi).  His passion for her led him to neglect the state and invite a dangerous rebellion, for which he was forced by his own army to have her executed.[白居易、平安、楊貴妃][RK]"
