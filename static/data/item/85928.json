        "As conducted in the Edo period, the [Tenjin] lectures began with a school's pupils presenting offerings of food and drink before an image of Michizane while praying for success in their studies and especially in their calligraphy.  Their teacher would then offer a lecture on Michizane's virtues and achievements.  The service would conclude with a reading of a text known as the Tenjin Sutra (p. 330). [道真、天神経]"
