        "Gyo'e kaji (J.) 御衣加持, sometimes pronounced onzo kaji, and also referred to as 後加持 go-kaji. Consecration of the imperial robes performed in the first and second half of each night of the Latter Seven-Day Rite, following the completion of the regular seris of rites. Although some commentaries suggest that the emperor originally attended the rite at the Shingon chapel instead of dispatching the robes, no contemporary confirmation exists in the historical record."
