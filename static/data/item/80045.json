        "Enma (J.) 閻魔（天）, also written as 焔魔, 焔摩, and referred to as 閻魔王,閻魔羅社, 閻羅, 縛, 双王, 獄主, 獄帝 Enma-ō, Enmarasha, Enra, Baku, Futa-ō, Gokushu, Gokutei. Lord of Death, Enma (Sk. Yama) oversees the distribution of karmic justice on the dead. In China, belief in Enma was tied to that in the Earth Store bodhisattva (地蔵 Ch. Ti-tsang; J. Jizō), and in the Scripture of the Ten Kings (十王経 Ch. Shih-wang ching) was represented as overseeing the underworld agency which distributes the effects of transgressions on the 35th day after death. In Japan, Enma was known from very early on, and was identified with Jizō in tale collections such as 日本霊異記 Nihon ryōiki of the early 9th c."
