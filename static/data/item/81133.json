        "A record of talks of Ōe no Masafusa (1041-1111) transcribed by a youthful disciple along with, perhaps, some of the anecdotes he himself had recordced.  Subjects covered are men, Chinese poetry, public affairs-meaning ceremonial, not economics of the science of governing, despite his actual activities--the supernatural, and learning as a virtuoso accomplishment (p. 389). [大江匡房]"
