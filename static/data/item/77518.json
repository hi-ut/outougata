        "A verb originally meaning to be in accord,\" became used as a noun to designate military units during the fourteenth century. Ikki were often cemented through oaths designed to show that all were in accord. Such groupings constituted corporate entities that possessed a status similar to that of a tozama warrior, but which remained dependant on a lord, and thus functioned like a miuchi. Warriors tended to form ikki as a means of resisting the increasing powers of regional magnates, or shugo, during the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. [外様、身内]\""
