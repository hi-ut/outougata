        "Derived from a verb meaning to attend on a superior, samurai was used in that sense (in its earlier pronunciation of saburai) in an early-eighth-century chronicle to designate civilian attendants assigned to the old or infirm or in the menial service of the sovereign, and it continued to be used in that nonmilitary sense in the Heian period for low-ranking servants of the nobility.  As a title within court society, samurai was also applied to military attendants (p. 645)."
