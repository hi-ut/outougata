        "The term shotō kanmotsu was used from the middle Heian Period to refer to the various taxes, especially the rice tax. Under the ritsuryō system, kanmotsu referred to the various types of tribute goods, including land, labor, and miscellaneous goods. However, from the middle of the Heian Period on, the terms kanmotsu and shotō kanmotsu became commonly used. Simultaneous with the establishment of shotō kanmotsu, terms for other types of taxes such as buyaku (labor for such purposes as land reclamation and irrigation projects, repair of roads, transportation of tax rice, and military service), rinji zōyaku, (extraordinary services), and shotō zōji (miscellaneous tax services) came into being.   After the Kamakura Period there are also instances of kanmotsu referring to the annual taxes on a shōen. [律令、夫役、臨時雑役、所当雑事、荘園]"
