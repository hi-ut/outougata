        "10 Hokke lectures\" assembly which, like the better known Hokke hakkō, consists of lectures on the Lotus sra, in this case supplemented with lectures on the 無量義経 Muryōgikyō and 観普賢経 Kanfugengyō at the beginning and end. Begun by the monk Gonzō (758-827) of Iwabuchidera in 796, the Hokke lectures were commonly sponsored by aristocrats from the 10th c. on, usually to transfer merit to deceased loved ones, though sometimes for the future salvation of themselves or close relatives. \""
