        "This massive ritual text produced at the order of emperor Daigo over the course of the period from 905 to 927 built on the precedents of the Kōninshiki (ca. 810-24) and Jōganshiki (to be distinguished from Jōgan gishiki; ca. 870) and served as the most dependable manual of court protocol and politics for centuries after."
