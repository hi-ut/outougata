        "At these Day of the Rat outings, the participants strolled about picking parsley, shepherd's purse (nazuna), and other edible plants, and pulling up tiny pine trees, which, although also edible, were valued primarily as symbols of longevity--and, because of their green color, as harbingers of spring.... In the Heian times, it was customary to go on outings to Kitano, Murasakino, or other nearby rural areas (pp. 378-9)[薺、北野、紫野]"
