        "[School text] dating from the Heian period and written in Chinese.  [Its] content was largely Confucian in tone--urging the virtues of fidelity, reverence for teacher, and so forth--but with a generous admixture of popular Buddhist thought:  the ephemerality of the present life, the horrors of the hells, the possible rewards of paradise, and even the prospects for happiness and wealth in this world (p. 719)."
