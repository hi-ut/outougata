        "In five phase theory, each of the seasons has a corresponding phase (spring to wood, summer to fire, fall to metal and winter to water). However, the phase earth has no official season, and so the 18 days before the beginning of each season is considered “of the earth.” Disturbing the earth (such as by digging) during this period was a traditional taboo, and so funerals were often postponed past its end.
