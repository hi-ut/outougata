        "Another name for the Hokumen-no-bushi (North-Facing Warriors ). A group of warriors (bushi) who acted as the guards of the Ex-Sovereign (In ), corresponding to the troops of the Headquarters of the Guards (Efu) of the Sovereign (Tennō ). Called North-Facing\" because the ruler always faced southward, so his warriors standing in front of him always faced toward the north. [北面武士、武士、院、衛府、天皇]\""
