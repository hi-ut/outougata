        "ad hoc legislation issued as royal edicts (choku 勅, mikotonori 詔, sei 制) or as directives (kanpu 官符) of the Council of State, to implement ritsuryō governance. Many such orders are recorded in official histories such as the eighth-century Shoku nihongi. They are also referred to in such legal commentaries as the Ryō no shūge 令集解. A useful compendium of kyaku issued up to the early tenth century and topically arranged is the Ruijū sandai kyaku 類聚三代格, compiled in the tenth century. [律令、続日本紀]"
