        "Aquilaria malaccensis Lam., Aquilaria Agallocha Robx. Aquilaria is a tall tree native to South and Southeast Asia similar to daphne. It has green leaves all year round. Fine quality samples have a lustrous black coloring and are called kyara. The heartwood frequently becomes infected with a fungus producing an aromatic resin, commonly called aloeswood, agarwood, and oud. The resin-rich wood (jinkō), used for fine Japanese incense, is extremely rare, difficult to obtain, and expensive. Legend tells of aloeswood being buried under the ground for hundreds of years."
