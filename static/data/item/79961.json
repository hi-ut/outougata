        "Adachi Yasumori (安達泰盛), clerical name of  Kakushin (覚真).  This attendant of shōgun Kujō Yoritsugu (1239-56) came to be a powerful member of the Kamakura shogunate in the 1260s and 1270s, but entered into a struggle with Taira Yoritsuna in 1285, whereupon Taira's slandering of Adachi to Hōjō Sadatoki led to his and his family's destruction."
