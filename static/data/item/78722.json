        "The Tanabata festival, on the seventh night of the seventh month.  This was when, according to an originally Chinese legend, the celestial lovers (the Weaver Star and the Herdboy Star, on either side of the Milky Way) came together for their one night a year.  The festival celebrated particularly poetry, calligraphy, and sewing.[七夕][RK]"
