        "a township in the provincial administrative system initiated by the Taihō Code. One ri comprised fifty ko, and from two to twenty ri made up one district, or gun. In 715, however, the use of the term ri was discontinued in favor of gō, which was to comprise two or three redefined ri. These later ri might be termed administrative villages.\" The head of a township was the richō 里長. In 740 the ri was abolished as a unit of provincial administration. [大宝律令、戸、郡、郷] \""
