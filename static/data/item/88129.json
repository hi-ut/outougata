        "The precepts normally condemned wild words\" (kyōgen-the term appeared centuries before the theatrical genre of the same name) and \"specious phrases\" as impediments to enlightenment. Kigo (frivolous, flattering, scatterbrained talk) is enumerated among Ten Evils (jūaku, daśakuśala) to be avoided. However, writers of the medieval period frequently seized on the four-character phrase made famous by the influential Chinese poet, Po Chü-I (772-846); see note 86) to justify literary activity as a kind of Skillful Means (hōben, q. v.) by which to reach the unenlightened. Murasaki Shikibu uses a similar argument in her defense of the novel in the Tale of Genji, Book 25.　[十悪、方便、紫式部]\""
