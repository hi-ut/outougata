        "A private school of the Fujiwara family in which young men of only this clan were permitted to study to become officials.  Professors (Hakase) were chosen generally from the Ōe and Sugawara families. It was located in Kyōto, having been established by Fujiwara Fuyutsugu in 821. It was sometimes called the Southern Office (Nansō) because it was south of the Bureau of Education (Daigakuryō ). [藤原、博士、大江、菅原、藤原冬嗣、南曹、大学寮]"
