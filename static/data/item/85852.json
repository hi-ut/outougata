        "[The incident began with] Heizei's resumption of an old love affair with Fujiwara no Kusuko (d. 810), the mother of one of his concubines.  To make matters worse, Kusuko's brother tried to take political advantage of her intimacy with the emperor.  Finally, in 809 after only three years as sovereign, Heizei abdicated on account of illness.  He was succeeded by his younger brother, who became Emperor Saga.  Heizei subsequently recovered his health, however, and found retirement not to his liking.  When, in turn, Saga fell ill in 810, Heizei seized the opportunity to regain his power and proclaimed that the capital was to be returned to its former site at Nara, where he had taken up residence with Kusuko. Fighting eventually broke out between the emperor and the former emperor.  Heizei was captured, but the blamed was placed on his advisers, most of whom were members of Kusuko's Ceremonial House (Shikike) of the Fujiwara, and were duly sent into exile.  Kusuko himself committed suicide and earned the dubious distinction of having the disturbance named after her, The Kusuko Incident\" (p. 38). [平城天皇、藤原薬子、嵯峨天皇、式家] \""
