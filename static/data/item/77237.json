        "An ancient dyeing technique in which cloth is usually folded before being clamped between two boards with patterns of intaglio grooves carved into their interior surfaces. Dye runs only through these grooves and pools in the grooves, thereby coloring only the pattern sections. This process can be repeated with different boards and different dyes to create complex multicolored designs."
