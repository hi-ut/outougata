        "A general, appointed from the ranks of noted families on a provisional basis. With the fall of the Kamakura bakufu, most generals were either collaterals of the Ashikaga lineage, imperial princes or court nobles. Their powers were formidable, but rarely institutionalized. Although taishō proved more capable of mobilizing troops than shugo, after the hanzei edicts of 1351, shugo could more effectively wield military force because they could systematically provision their armies.[大将、守護、半済]"
