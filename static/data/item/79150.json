        "An ancient dyeing technique in which cloth is folded and clamped between two boards with patterns of intaglio grooves carved into their interior surfaces. When the clamped boards are placed in the dyebath, the dye runs only through these grooves, coloring only pattern sections. This process can be repeated with different boards and different dyes to create complex multicolored designs."
