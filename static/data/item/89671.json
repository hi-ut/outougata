        "The Imperial Stables of the Left and Right were in charge of the Imperial horses and their trappings. Both from the Meryō's own breeding grounds in eastern Japan and from provincial pastures supervised by the War Ministry, animals were brought to the capital each year to be used as mounts for Imperial Messengers, as gifts to religious institutions and senior nobles, and as participants in certain annual ceremonies. Before the cessation of military operations in early Heian and the contemporaneous appearance of the ox-drawn carriage, the horse had been greatly prized in Japan, a circumstance that perhaps accounts for the relatively high prestige attached to the principal Meryō positions. In Michinaga's day, it was almost always young men from the upper social brackets, such as Prince Genji's friend Sama no Kami, who filled the four posts of regular and provisional Director (Kami) and regular and provisional Assistant Director (Suke) in each of the two organizations [p816].
