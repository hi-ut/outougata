        "Bodaisho (菩提所), also referred to as bodaiji (菩提寺), kōge'in (香華院).  An outgrowth of the gradual splintering of great clans such as the Fujiwaras who sponsored the construction of clan-temples (氏寺 ujidera) from the 7th century on, the bodaisho or bodhi sites\" were temples constructed on behalf of lineages from the Heian era on, and which primarily offered memorial   services in an effort to transfer merit (回向 ekō) to deceased ancestors, though sometimes to produce future merit during the life of the rite's sponsor (i.e., so-called 逆修 gyakushu).\""
