        "Fu (Ch.) 符 J. oshite, warifu. These tallies were especially known in early China as guarantors of the allegience of followers to military and other leaders. The Japanese pronunciation oshite was noted in Nihon shoki, referring in this case to the seal produced from the imprint of the emperor's hand on documents."
