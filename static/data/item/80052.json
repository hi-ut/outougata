        "Fudō myō (J.) 不動明王、also referred to as 不動尊, 不動威怒明王, 無動尊, 不動使者, 阿遮羅曩他 Fudōson, Fudōinu myō, Mudōson, Fudōshisha, Asharanōta. The most popular among the 5 Great Venerables (Godai son), Fudō (Sk. Acalanātha) is known particularly in esoteric Buddhsm as the awesome messenger of Dainichi. Surrounded to the rear by flames, Fudō usually carries a sword in his right hand and a rope in his left which he uses to destroy the afflictions (bonnō) or any other impediments which keep beings from believing in Buddhism. In Japan, Fudō has had a prominent place since the introduction of esoteric Buddhism, and has been especially associated with protection of Buddhism and its patrons. Esoteric rites invoking the powers of Fudō were prominent from the 9th c. on, and were conducted usually for purposes of avoiding calamity or overcoming enemies, though on occasion for the acquisition of wealth. Kūkai and Enchin were particularly known for their performance of rites to Fudō, and well-known images of Fudō are held in Tōji, Kōyasan, and Onjōji (Heian era)."
