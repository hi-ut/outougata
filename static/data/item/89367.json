        "The Putting On of the Trousers (hakamagi or chakko), a rite of passage for noble children of both sexes, marked the attainment of a certain stage in the child's development, usually celebrated at three (sai), but sometimes delayed until five, six, or seven....The ceremony centered around the formal donning of a skirtlike pair of trousers (hakama), presented by one of the family's senior members, who also tied the strings of the garment (p. 393).
