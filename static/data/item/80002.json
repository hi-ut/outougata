        "Buddhist chapel established in Uji by Fujiwara no Yorimichi in 1052 on the grounds of a villa purchased by the Fujiwaras in the late 10th c.  The conversion of the grounds to a temple constituted an effort by Yorimichi to sacrifice of his own wealth (喜捨 kisha) in response to what was thought to be the advent of the Last Age (mappō) in the same year.  Construction of images of Amida Buddha and other figures in the Phoenix Hall ensued as part of an effort to recreate the atmosphere of the Pure Land."
