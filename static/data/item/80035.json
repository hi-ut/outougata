        "Dōkyō (J.) 道教, also called 遍智院大僧都 Henchi'in daisōzu. Founder of the Dōkyō lineage of the Sanbōin line of the Ono branch of Shingon. Although a disciple of the monk Seigen and given all of the proper initiations by his master, Dōkyō died in 1236 at the age of 36 and so was not able to open up a platform for transmitting the dharma; he did, however, succeed on his death bed in transmitting the teaching to 浄尊 Jōson (fl. 1270), who carried on the lineage, and to Jinken, both of whom later transmitted what they had learned from Dōkyō to 親快 Shinkai (1215-76), founder of the Shinkai lineage of the Sanbōin line. Shinkai later received from Jōson a large manuscript collection bequeathed by Dōkyō."
