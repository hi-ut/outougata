        "True Heirs of the Lin-chi sect.  For intrasectarian purposes, Obaku masters tended to prefer the term Rinzai shōshū, the designation chosen by Mi-yun and Fei-yin to symbolize their dedication to restoring Lin-chi's Ch'an style.  The term Rinzai shōshū\" was not originally selected to reflect any polemical evaluations in regard to the Rinzai lineage in Japan, but rather toward other Chinese lineages (p. 221-222n).
