        "This 2nd shōgun of the Ashikaga bakufu was the 3rd son of Takauji, and was sent when still a child to oversee eastern Japan in Kamakura, but when his father and foster father Tadayoshi had their struggle for power in 1349, the 19-year-old Yoshiakira was sent back to Kyoto to handle the political affairs of the shogunate in Tadayoshi's stead. He became shōgun in 1358, but fell ill and died in 1367."
