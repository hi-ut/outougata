        "(or kaihatsu ryōshu) Heian-period local notables recognized as owners of the land they had brought under cultivation. Later, such public holdings\" were often commended to central nobles, producing the division into proprietary (central) and managerial (local) authorities. The \"original ownership\" was thus passed to an aristocratic shōen holder.　[荘園]　\""
