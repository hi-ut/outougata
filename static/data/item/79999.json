        "Butsugen-son (佛眼尊), also called Botaroshanō (没陀路沙曩), Henchigen (遍知眼), Butsugen butsumo (佛眼佛母). Buddhalocanā, originally representing the perfection of wisdom of the bodhisattva as the eye or mother of all Buddhas, is interpreted variously in esoteric Buddhism as a transformation of Dainichi, Shaka, or Kongōsatta.  Worshipped in esoteric rites from at least the 12th c. on, the most famous image of her is a silk portrait produced by Myōe. The monk Shōken, by imperial decree, performed a rite to her in an effort to find (and destroy) Minamoto no Yoshitsune in 1187."
