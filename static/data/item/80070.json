        "This aristocrat of the mid-Kamakura era rose to positions such as major controller of the right and left, leader of the chamberlains, deputy middle counsellor, and minister of popular affairs. Although he was close to figures such as the chancellor Kono'e Iezane, he is best known after his death at 62 in 1274 as the author of the voluminous diary Minkeiki."
