        "Service, in theory, was based upon loyalty--loyalty to the master and to his household as a sacred entity....  In merchant households...hōkō in theory involved not only service to one's master, but obedience ot the law, and to the Tokugawa regime that had pacified the country; concern for the welfare of society; and the notion of shokubun--work as gratitude to society (p. 41).
