        "Imperial lineage descended from Go-Fukakusa, a son of Emperor Go-Saga. Go-Fukakusa's descendants, Fushimi, Go-Fushimi, Hanazono, and Kogon, alternated succession to the throne with Daikakuji rivals. Jimyo'in monarchs staffed the Northern Court during the civil war and, after the conclusion of the civil war. continue to occupy the throne. See also the Daikakuji lineage."
