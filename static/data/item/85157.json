        "Reforms instigated between 1841 and 1843 by the roju Mizuno Echizen no Kami Tadakuni in the hopes of strengthening the bakufu. Mizuno dismantled guilds of wholesalers, lowered or froze prices, stressed austerity in consumption, and attempted to stop immoral activities. These reforms ended in almost total failure."
