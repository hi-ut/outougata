        "Each of the two Controllers' Offcies supervised four of the eight governmental ministries.  All Daijōkan documents also passed across their desks, and they served as the Council's main links with the cetnral and provincial bureaucracies, processing documents from the ministries and provinces and forwarding information to Council members.  They were headed by Controllers (Ben or Benkan), varying in number between six and nine (including provisional appointments), who were divided into three categories, Major, Middle, and Lesser, with prescribed ranks in the tenjōbito range (p. 800).
