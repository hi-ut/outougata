        "A Kofukuji chronicle (also known as Tokondo saisai yoki) in seven volumes that documents especially events pertaining to the cloisters within the temple complex from 1333 to 1391. It was written by Jitsugon, an abbot of one of Kofukuji's smaller cloisters. The early entries are especially interesting and appear to be reliable even though the chronicle is not contemporaneous."
