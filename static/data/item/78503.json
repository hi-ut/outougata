        "In the tale, an unofficial title for a woman (especially an Intimate or a Consort) who had borne a child to an Heir Apparent, an Emperor, or a Retired Emperor.  The Japanese term suggests either “place [person] in whom the august affection found rest” or “place [person] in whom the august seed found rest.”  Examples in the tale include Genji’s mother after Genji’s birth; the Rokujō Haven, whose daughter is by a deceased Heir Apparent; the Akashi Daughter after she bears the Heir Apparent a son; the mother of Princess Ochiba, Emperor Suzaku’s daughter; and Tamakazura’s elder daughter, who bears a child to Retired Emperor Reizei.[源氏、六条、明石、落葉、朱雀、玉鬘、冷泉][RK]"
