        "The word chūma first appears in the documentary record in 1694. Sevral theories have been propounded as to the origins of the term, the characters for which literally mean middle horse,\" but Furushima Toshio, the foremost scholar of the  chūma system, makes persuative case for the characters having been chosen phonetically to fit a spoken slurring of teuma (literally \"hand houses\"). The latter in turn may have been an abbreviation of temae uma, a common alternative term for zaigō ma, which suggests that -in contrast to th reserve teams of the post towns-peasants simply used horses that were \"at hand.\"[中馬, 手前馬, 在郷馬](Footnote) \""
