        "Exempt from the payment of all tribute in kind (chō), the commuted tax (yō), or the rendering of regular annual forced labor (yōeki), or additional forced labor (zatsuyō). However, had to pay the tax of rice on paddy fields (so) and make the regular contributions to the granaries for famine years (gisō). A person who was exempt from taxation generally did not have to serve in the conscripted armies. All members of the Imperial Family, persons of the Eighth Rank (Hachi-i) or above, men sixteen years of age or younger, very old men, all women, sick persons, cripples, retainers (kenin), and slaves (nuhi) were exempt from taxation.
