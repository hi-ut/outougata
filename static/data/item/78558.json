        "A walled space normally two bays square and located at one end of the chamber (moya).  It could be used both as a storeroom and a sleeping room, and it might contain a curtained bed (michōdai).  There were small double doors (tsumado) between it and the chamber, and perhaps also between it and the northern aisle.[母屋、御帳台、妻戸][RK]"
