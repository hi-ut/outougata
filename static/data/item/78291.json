        "The space in a house that surrounded the chamber (moya), between the chamber and the veranda (sunoko).  It was normally divided into sections, or rooms.  The aisle was lower than the chamber by the depth of the lintel (nageshi).  Exceptionally, there could be a second width (or pollution) beyond the first, again a lintel-depth lower.[簀子、母屋、長押][also 庇] [RK]"
