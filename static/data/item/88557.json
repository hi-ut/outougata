        "Literally, custodial office\", but actually the office name (shiki) commonly given by absentee proprietors to large-scale commenders of land. In time, this title came to have the additional meaning of a proprietor's deputy, that is, an officer representing the domain owner's interests. Sometimes, also, central families not of the highest status were called azukari dokoro over hereditary estates. In such instances they would be virtual proprietors (ryōke): above them would stand only a \"patron\" (honke).  [職、領家、本家]　[Cf. Mass, 1976.]\""
