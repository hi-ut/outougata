        "viceroy, the royal chief-of-staff. From the later ninth century, members of the Northern Fujiwara family with close affinal connections to the throne held this leading ministerial office. In 887 Uda Tennô described the post thusly: “Without the protection of the prime minister (who was kampaku), how could I proclaim the royal will throughout the realm and make straight the way of heavenly governance in the palace? . . . He assembles all officialdom, so let every matter be entrusted to him and let him (then) advise me. Whatever he proposes, it is as if it were already done.”"
