        "So called because it contained storage facilities for dining tables (daiban).  This sizeable apartment served as the headquarters of the Emperor's ladies-in-waiting and corresponded to the Tenjō no Ma for the courtiers.  Men were barred from entering it without special permission.  In addition to the dining tables, it contained an Imperial Chair, a duty-board for female officials, and miscellaneous items, such as chests, braziers, and games(p. 843). [殿上間]"
