        "Official envoys of the Imperial Government despatched to the court of the T'ang dynasty. The regular officials were the Great Envoys to the T'ang (Ken-Tō-taishi) and the Vice-Envoys to the T'ang (Ken-Tō-fukushi ), but sometimes Controlling Envoys to the T'ang (Ken-Tō-ōshi) or Envoys Extraordinary to the T'ang (Ken-Tō-shissetsushi) were sent. These were superior in rank to the regular Great Envoys to the T'ang. [遣唐大使、遣唐副使、遣唐押使、遣唐執節使]"
