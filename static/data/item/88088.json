        "A word with a variety of meanings (see Takakusu 1956, p. 57), the two most common of which are sometimes confused: (1) Dharma as the teachings of Buddhism, the Law; and (2) dharmas as ultimate psychophysical elements whose successive combining and disjunction constitutes the gross forms of the entire phenomenal world, which are thus without any persisting self or substance (shohō muga; see mujō and kū entries).
