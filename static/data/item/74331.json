        "penal (ritsu) and administrative (ryō) legal codes, patterned after those of China and first adopted by the Japanese government at the turn of the eighth century. The codes were fleshed out and amended by supplementary laws (kyaku 格) and protocols (shiki 式) from later Nara times onward. Many historians refer to the eighth and ninth centuries as “the ritsuryō age,” because the codes remained a focus of court concern and scholarship at the time."
