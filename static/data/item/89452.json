        "The Lime Altar, floored with a mixture of dirt and lime (ishibai), was a Shinto sanctuary where the Emperor, assisted by women from the Handmaids' Office, worshiped Amaterasu and other important deities each morning, seated on a bench surrounded by screens depicting the four seasons (p. 843)."
