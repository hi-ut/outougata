        "The chōsen form of document appeared in the mid-Heian Period along with the system that allowed for absentee appointments.  This system allowed first- and second-level manager-provincial governors to stay in the capital instead of being forced to travel to their assigned posts in the countryside.  The absentee governors, in order to manage their respective lands, needed to send documents to the Absentee Office (rusudokoro) of the provincial office.  They did so in a chōsen. [留守所]"
