        "Series fo legal codes drawn up initially by Hōjō Yasutoki in 1232. Significant for it codifies judicial norms of land ownership, and provided mechanisms for disputes to be adjudicated by the Kamakura bakufu. Administrative regulations, such as punishments for those who failed to report when summoned, were initially ignored, but their enforcement late in the thirteenth century led to an upswing in judicial violence (see akutō). Go-Daigo attempted to nullify these laws, but they were largely upheld in the next sequence of legal codes, the Kenmu Shikimoku, that were promulgated by the Ashikaga in 1336. [北条泰時、悪党、後醍醐、建武式目]"
