        "d. 658.  This Prince was Kōtoku-Tennō's son by a daughter of the late Great Minister of the Left (Sadaijin) Abe Kurahashimaro.  While Saimei-Tennō was away, Soga Akae, who had been left to guard the capital, visited Arima-Ōji and criticized the government.  Later the Prince returned the visit and the two men were said to have planned a rebellion.  That very night after returning home Arima-Ōji was besieged and captured by troops sent by his fellow conspirator, Soga Akae. He was then accused by Nakano-Ōe-no-Ōji (Tenchi-Tennō) of plotting against the government (Part A, p. 150). [孝徳天皇、左大臣、阿倍倉梯麻呂、斉明天皇、蘇我赤兄、中大兄皇子、天智天皇]"
