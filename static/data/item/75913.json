        "“The six precept-observing days,” i.e. 8th, 14th, 15th, 23rd, 29th, and 30th of every month. It is believed that on those days the Four Guardian Kings (Shitennō) examine people’s acts, or that evil spirits seek opportunities to capture people’s minds.  People therefore abstain from breaking the precepts, including that of not eating after midday (hence, sai meaning ‘abstinence’).” [四天王]"
