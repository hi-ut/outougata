        "A geographic division; for administrative purposes. Each division consisted of several provinces (kuni). In Japan there were the Saikaidō, San'yōdō, San'indō, Nankaidō, Hokurokudō, Tōkaidō、Tōsandō, Hokkaidō, and the Kinai (Inner Provinces), although strictly speaking the last was not a division (dō), and the Hokkaidō did not appear until much later in Japanese histotry. Consequently, the Japanese Empire is referred to in documents most frequently as the Five Inner Provinces (Go-Kinai) and the Seven Divisions (Shichi-dō)."
