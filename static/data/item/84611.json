        "An ad hoc organ created in 1069 to adjudicate land disputes. It went out of existence in 1071, but reappeared from time to time. In Masukagami, the term refers to the office established in 1321 by Emperor Go-Daigo, which appears to have functioned as that ruler's primary decisionmaking instrument. [増鏡　後醍醐天皇]"
