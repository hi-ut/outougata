        "People who inhabit the shore and live from the sea, whether men or women, fishermen, divers for shellfish and seaweed, or saltmakers.  In poetry, an ama is often particularly a young and attractive girl, and the seashore imagery associated with the word could easily have erotic overtones.  Since ama is homophonous with the word for “nun,” a good many poems exploit this double meaning.[海女・海人][also 海人][RK]"
