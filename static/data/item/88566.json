        "Originally a title held by the chief monk of a large temple, such as Nara's Tōdaiji or Nagano City's Zenkōji. It was associated with construction and maintenance of temple buildings, and thus, in the early Kamakura period, was the title given to↓Chōgen, the monk in charge of rebuilding Tōdaiji between 1180 and 1206. It was a Court-appointed title and continued to be granted to monks in charge of temple construction projects through the Tokugawa period.　[東大寺、善光寺、重源]"
