        "（alt., tsuki, mitsugi) By the late seventh century there were two types of tribute, one levied on the residential unit (ko) and the other levied on rice fields (ta 田), both payable in cloth. According to the later codes, in which the influence of T'ang China was strong, chō tribute was to be levied on taxable males-including the old and the adolescent, who nonetheless paid less-payable in cloth or regional produce. That latter may have reflected the merger of earlier forms of symbolic tribute such as onie (products of mountain and sea for the Great King's table) into the codal chō, which was essentially an extractive form of tribute. There were three classes of taxable males, with a member of the top class mandated to pay three times that of a member of the lowest class. Tribute in the form of cloth, thread, iron, iron tools, salt, and other local goods was sent to the royal treasury, or Ōkurashō 大蔵省, which was supposed to use the proceeds to provision government in the capital and to pay official salaries.　[戸]"
