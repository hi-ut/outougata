        "A twenty-year statute of limitations, after which no counterclaims would be recognized either to possession of a shiki or to the practices and perquisites attendant on that possession. Written into Kamakura's Jōei Code of 1232, though enforcement was only sporadic. The reference to nenjo in some documents means simply a period long enough to cast doubt on any charge.　[職、貞永式目]"
