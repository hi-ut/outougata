        "Local warriors who exercised political and military control and possessed the power to collect dues from the cultivators within a locale, by retaining autonomy of power from a higher political authority or military power. Although such warriors existed throughout the medieval period, over time most either became vassals of the military estate steward (jitō), military governor (shugo), shugo daimyo, or sengoku daimyo. Others retained their autonomy independently or collectively by forming military leagues (ikki). Some, increasingly referred to in the Muromachi period as regional military lords (kokujin), themselves became sengoku daimyo. See also jitō, kokujin, sengoku daimyō, shugo, shugo daimyō, ikki.　[地頭、国人、戦国大名、守護、守護大名、一揆]"
