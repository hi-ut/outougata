        "An organized attempt in 1177 by officers of the retired emperor's household, acting in league with some military figures, to move against the Taira leader.  The plot was discovered and crushed before it could be put into action, however, leaving Kiyomori more powerful than ever but with a heightened enmity toward Go-Shirakawa and his court (p. 696).
