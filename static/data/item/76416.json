        "This can mean either a draft of a document, or a copy of a document that has been prepared in an office. Usually the copy would be kept, whilst the original was often sent on and added to by the next office in the chain of command, who would then make a further copy and keep it. Thus several different 'copies' of the same document would exist, reflecting the various stages of its progress through promulgation."
