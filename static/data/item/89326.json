        "[Also written 儀陽殿]↓The Giyōden, southeast of the Shishinden, was one of the most secure of the Palace structure, since the Bodyguards of the Left not only manned the adjacent Nikkamon Gate, but also maintained an office in the Building itself.  Perhaps for that reason, as well as because of its proximity to the Shishinden, it was designated Dairi site for high-level discussions of affairs of state (p. 848).[紫宸殿、日華門、内裏]"
