        "Hinokuma jingū (J.) 日前神宮, referred to more generally as 日前国懸神宮 Hinokuma-kunikakasu jingū This actually constitutes a pair of shrines, Hinokuma jing・and Kunikakasu jingū located respectively to the west and east on the same grounds, Wakayama prefecture. Closely related to imperial legend and power presumably since the ancient era, the shrines appear in records of the 8th c., and were the objects of at least semi-regular offerings by the imperial government from 9th c. on."
