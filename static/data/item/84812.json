        "the system of ranks (I) and posts (kan) established by the ritsuryō codes, which essentially reconfigured the old royal domain based on the structures of <i>uji</i> and kabane. According to the kan'I logic of the codes, each post was attainable only by persons who had attained a given rank. Ranks were granted based on qualifications related to heredity, talent, and loyal service to the throne. Regulation of both ranks and posts thus empowered the throne. [律令、氏、姓]"
