        "This term refers either to wares with any combination of three lead-based glazes - white,green,or yellow - or to any ceramic with multiple glaze colors. The former usage is standard. The best known three-color wares come from Tang-dynasty China, but the sixty pieces of sansai in the Shōsō-in were all made domestically and are thus called Nara sansai. [正倉院]"
