        "buddha-anusmrti. As the parts of the word suggest, nembutsu originally referred to thinking (nen) on the Buddha as an adjunct to meditation. This interpretation of the term, based on such scriptures as the Hanjusammaikyō (Visualization [of Amida] Sutra, T. 418, was gradually replaced by the view of the practice as calling on the holy name (shōmyō nembutsu). For the extreme followers of Hōnen and Shinran, solely uttering the Name\" (senju nembutsu) was the only religious practice necessary, or even possible, as human ability to attain the Dharme deteriorated during the Latter Days of the Law (mappō; see also sanji).
