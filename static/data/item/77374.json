        "A mouth organ held vertically with removable bamboo pipes set into a wood wind chamber and held in place by a metal girth. The pipe reeds vibrate both with exhaled and inhaled breath when small holes in the sides of the pipes are stopped with a finger. It is thus possible to produce single notes and tone clusters. The wind chambers of many shō are coated with black lacquer and often decorated with elaborate designs using various techniques."
