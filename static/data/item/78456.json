        "An office that functioned as an imperial secretariat, serving the Emperor and carrying messages and imperial orders.  It was staffed by two higher-ranking Secretaries (Kurōdo no Tō), by Chamberlains (Kurōdo) of the fifth rank and sixth ranks, and by a number of lesser figures.  A Chamberlain moved in circles above his official rank, served the Emperor directly, and held privileges such as the right to wear colours normally not allowed a man of his rank.  The Chamberlains’ Office also looked after the Emperor’s falcons and took care of musical instruments, books, coins (metal currency) and clothing.[蔵人頭、蔵人][RK]"
