        "This refers to a specific punishment defined in the Laws on Prisons (gokuryō) that allows for those with rank who have been convicted of a crime to submit to losing one unit of rank rather than being entirely stripped of post, rank, and valorous merit.  The principle behind the law is based on the saying in Tang China that courtiers are not to be punished, and soldiers are to be executed, for neither must not know shame. [獄令]"
