        "In the 790s when Emperor Kanmu required timber to build his new imperial capital at Heian, he designated Yamaguni as imperial forest (gosoma goryōchi or kinri goryōchi).  IN later centuries the imperial court retained the area as estate land (shōen), and those resident holders of woodland who had the customary legal function of purveying wood to the court managed lumbering operations in the dozen villages that comprised the Yamaguni area.  Their descendants retained that function, and as of 1600, about a hundred locally prominent households controlled most of the woodland in the villages of Yamaguni (pp. 84-5). [桓武天皇、平安、山国、禁裏御料地、荘園]"
