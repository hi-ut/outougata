        "(alt., ōchikara) stores of tribute rice generally kept at district offices but under the superintendence of provincial governors. The stores were to be used for support of local governance. Yearly inventories called shōzeichō 正税帳 were to be submitted by governors to the Ministry of Popular Affairs. Twenty-three such reports are extant. Various experiments to streamline the system were attempted during the Tempyō era (天平, 729-67), when fiscal demands on provincial resources increased exponentially."
