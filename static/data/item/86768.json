        "....in 1591, Hideyoshi instructed the daimyo to conduct a village-by-village census (hitobarai) of their domains, a recording of the population and the numbers of households in rural areas that was designed to prevent the peasants from absconding and to bind them more tightly to the land (p. 525)."
