        "Documents of arrival, were submitted by warriors who arrived in camp. This format originated as a means of reporting for guard duty late in the thirteenth century. These documents merely proved a warrior's arrival, but did not necessarily indicate that he had performed military service. Some chakutōjō do, however, closely resemble petitions for reward in that they also describe military encounters. See gunchūjō and kassen chūmon. [軍忠状、合戦注文]"
