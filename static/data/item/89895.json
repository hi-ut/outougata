        "Tōtō, Saitō, and Yokawa, collectively known as santō (three Buddhist halls\"; by extension, \"three compounds\").  Three centers in the main valleys on Mount Hiei, each consisting of a principal hall and many lesser buildings, and together composing most of the great Enryakuji.  The Eastern Compound was the central area of the temple, the Western Compound lay to the northwest, and Yokawa was on the north (p. 538n). [東塔、西塔、横川、比叡山、延暦寺]\""
