        "One of the phases of daimyō development observed by modern historians. A shugo with sufficient power to be referred to informally as a daimyō. Specifically, when a shugo was able to amass all the uniform provincial levies, usually in the form of tansen, in his territory for himself alone, he could be called a daimyō.　[段銭]"
