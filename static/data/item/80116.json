        "Gōzanze Myō (J.) 降三世明王, also referred to as 怛隷路迦毘惹耶, 勝三世 Tareirokabijaya, Shōzanze, with the alternative names of 縛日羅吽迦羅, 三世金剛, 聖三世, 忿怒月黶尊, 忿怒降三世, 孫婆菩薩 Bazaraunkara, Sanzekongō, Shōzanze, Funnugattenson, Funnugōzanze, Sonba bosatsu. One of the 5 awesome deities, Gozanze (Sk. Trailokyavijaya) corresponds with Ashuku among the 5 Buddhas of the Diamond mandala, and as a transformation of Kongōsatta corresponds as well with Dainichi. In the Womb mandala as presently used, he is represented togetherwith an awesome deity named Shōzanze, who is in reality the same deity; a variant explanation has it that Gōzanze is a transformation of Dainichi, while Shōzanze is a transformation of the bodhisattva Jizō. Gōzanze is famous for having destroyed the deity Shiva in esoteric Buddhist myth, and was worshipped for purposes of military victory, though sometimes to avoid illness or acquire love. Figures of him are almost invariably preserved with the other 5 awesome deities."
