        "Japanese who had been captured by the Ezo either in battle, or who had moved inro Ezo territory and had submitted to the rule of the barbarians of their own free will. Later the term came to include all those Japanese settlers and frontiersmen in the Eastern Provinces (Tōgoku), particularly in Mutsu- and Dewa-no-kuni, who refused to obey the officials of the central government, or who intermarried with the Ezo and identified themselves with the barbarians, and all the descendants of such people."
