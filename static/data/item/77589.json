        "A commended estate, composed of partible shiki that expressed both status and function, appearing first in the eighth century, and continuing throughout the sixteenth. Most shōen had a far shorter life span. Although significant, they almost never constituted over half of a province's arable land. The classic\" estate of the twelfth and thirteenth century contained a hierarchy of shiki based on status and function, but this system of multiple ownership began to crumble in the fourteenth century as some local managers were granted shiki that had previously been the prerogative of central proprietors. Indeed, from the fourteenth-century onward, the conception of singular, or unitary (ichien) possession of lands strengthened. See shiki and ando. [一円、職、安堵]\""
