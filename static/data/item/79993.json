        "This term refers to the master of a realm invoked, most commonly used in connection with the main Buddhas of the Diamond and Womb Realm mandalas, each of which governs a section (bu; i.e., a group of corresponding figures) of his mandala.  It can also refer to to the figure who governs a particular chapel or area within a mandala, or to the leader of a group of figure venerated at an altar, such as Fudō among the 5 awesome deities (myō)."
