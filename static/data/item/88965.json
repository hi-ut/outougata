        "A massive chronicle of Tendai's Shoren'in monzeki. The twenty-ninth abbot of the Shoren'in, princely monk Sonshin, ordered it written, and it was probably completed in 1803, at which time the cloister was located in Kyoto. It focuses mainly on rituals and other procedures relating to the Shoren'in."
