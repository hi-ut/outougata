        "Arising originally from the ranks of commoners\" (hyakushō), samurai possessed surnames, and were obligated to a lord (tozama), rather than or their peers, and should be considered to be a retainer. They possessed considerably greater rights than did \"the base\" (i. e. immunity from torture. See bonge, genin). Best considered to be synonymous with miuchi, the term is inappropriate for tozama or gokenin. [百姓、外様、凡下、下人、身内、外様、御家人]\""
