        "(1065-1121) Kakushin was the son of Fujiwara no Morozane (clan chieftain from 1075 to 1094) and the first member of the chieftain's line to become head abbot of Kofukuji (1100). He was, however, opposed by Shirakawa, who temporarily relieved him of his duties in 1102. Kakushin was reinstated the following year and remained betto until his death in 1121."
