        "Hōbu (J.) 寶部. The jewel\" section among the 5 sections of the Diamond Realm mandala, that is, the part which includes the master of good fortune, the Buddha Hōshō. The section includes all those beings--especially the bodhisattvas of the southern wheel of the Jōjin'e, Kongōhō, Kongōkō, Kongōdō, and Kongōshō who, working under the direction of Hōshō, offer fortune to those who properly approach Hōshō. When approached, they operate as the assembly (集会 shūe) of the jewel section. This section, together with the other 4 sections of the other among the 5 Buddhas--仏部 butsubu (Dainichi), 金剛部 kongōbu (Ashuku), 蓮華部 rengebu (Muryōju=Amida), and 羯磨部 katsumabu (Fukūjōju)--corresponds with their 5 forms of wisdom. Strictly speaking, however, both hōbu and katsumabu can be included within the butsubu of Dainichi, which represents the mystery of the body (as opposed to those of speech and mind) among what are more commonly called 3 sections (sanbu) of the mandala.\""
