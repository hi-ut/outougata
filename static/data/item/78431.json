        "The double (Left and Right, Sakon and Ukon) corps of guards assigned to protect the palace proper and stationed in its innermost areas.  The Palace Guards had precedence over the Watch and the Gate Watch.  Their two Commanders (third rank, lower grade) outranked the Intendants of those units (fourth rank, lower grade).  A second-level officer was a Captain (Chūjō; fourth rank, lower grade), a third-level officer a Lieutenant (Shōshō; fifth rank, lower grade), and a fourth-level officer an Aide (Zō; sixth rank, upper grade).[左近、右近、中将、少将、丞][RK]"
