        "Literally crazy verses\"－satirical or humorous poems in 5-7-5-7-7 syllable form. Most kyoka poets assumed pseudonyms that included complex puns or literary allusions. These names are usually untranslatable; many are humorous only if the incompatibility of the semantic and phonetic values of the Sino-Japanese ideographs is sensed. Some authors chose to parody older poets: thus Hamabe no Kurohito (\"dark man on the waterfront\") is probably a spoof on Yamabe no Akahito, a Nara-period poet. Other names may allude to personal conditions: Yadoya no Meshimori, for example, means \"servant at the inn\" and refers to the fact that the poet ran an inn at Kodenma-cho in Edo.［浜辺黒人、山部赤人、奈良、宿屋飯盛、小伝馬町、江戸］\""
