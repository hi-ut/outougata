        "Henjō (J.) 遍昭, also called 僧正遍昭、華山僧正、中院僧正、良僧正 Sōjō henjō, Kazan sōjō, Chūin sōjo, Yoshi sōjō, with original lay name of 良岑宗貞 Yoshimine Munesada. Although he rose to the level of head chamberlain under emperor Ninmyō, with the death of the sovereign Yoshimine Munesada became a monk and took the clerical name of Henjō in 850. Studying under Ennin and then 安慧 Anne (795-868) at Mount Hiei, he took residence in the 雲林院 Urin'in chapel--the former detached palace of emperors Junna and Ninmyō, respectively--in 869. Initiated into esoteric ritual by Enchin in 873, he founded the Tendai temple 元慶寺 Gangyōji (also called Kazanji) in 877. He continued to have close ties with the court, evidenced by the fact that his 70th birthday was celebrated in the Jijūden in 885."
