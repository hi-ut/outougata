        "Usually a combination of two garments of different colours, or of garment and lining, so that one colour could be seen through the other.  Layerings had names, but the colours in them were not stable over time, and they are often uncertain.  The name often refers to the overall effect.  For example “cherry blossom,” white over scarlet, produced a pale cherry blossom pink.  Many layerings were seasonal and were also affected by the wearer’s age and rank. [RK]"
