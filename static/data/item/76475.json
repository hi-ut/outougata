        "At this time, the positions of kōgō and chūgū were undifferentiated and referred to the same figure. However, in the reign of Ichijō Tennō, the roles were separated when a second woman was raised to the status of Official Consort. The initial occupant was made Kōgō, while the new consort was appointed Chūgū. Therefore from this time it became customary to have more than one queen-consort. In such cases, the first consort to be appointed would be promoted from chūgū to kōgō if a new consort was appointed. Officially, the position of Kōgō was senior to that of Chūgū, even if there were many cases where the Chūgū was the more powerful figure. For this reason, from the reign of Ichijō Tennō onwards, kōgō should be translated as ‘senior queen-consort’, while chūgū should be ‘queen-consort’ in order to reflect the official difference which emerged between the two positions.
