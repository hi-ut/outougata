        "Father of Yasumori, this member of the shogunate succeeded as the envoy of the bakufu in discussions with the imperial family in 1242, and as a maternal relative of the shogunal regents Hōjō Tsunetoki and Hōjō Tokiyori he took a prominent role in the deliberations of the shogunate.  In 1247 he entered into a power struggle with the Miura clan, and used his close relationship with Tokiyori to gain victory, but later fell ill, dying in Kōya-sanin 1253."
