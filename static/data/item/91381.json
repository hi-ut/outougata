        "Highest post within the imperial bureaucracy, and the person appointed to the post was supposed to set a moral example for the rest of society.  Since one's moral qualities were the determinant factor in appointment to the post, it was not supposed to be filled unless a properly qualified individual was available.  Minister of the left was the second-highest post in the bureaucracy (pp. 54-55n)."
