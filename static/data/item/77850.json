        "A festival of Chinese origin held on the seventh day of the seventh month by the lunar calendar, celebrating the annual meeting of the Weaver Star (Vega) and Cowherd Star (Altair)-Legendary lovers separated by the Millky Way, who are said to come together only once a year on this day. Its rituals pray for improved sewing and weaving skills for women, but the festival also became associated with poetry composition, as evidenced by the poems on this theme in early Japanese poetry collections. [Also Tanabata (七夕）]"
