        "A small plant (Asarum caulescens), known more precisely as futaba aoi, （\"twin-leaf aoi\") and sacred to the Kamo Shrine.  A forest plant, it consists of a symmetrically opposed pair of broad, heart-shaped leaves, with which people decorated their headdresses and carriages for the Kamo Festival (as they did also with laurel [katsura]).  Aoi in its Heian spelling (afuhi) can be read to mean “day of [lovers’] meeting” and this double meaning is often exploited in poetry.[双葉葵、二葉葵、賀茂、桂、葵、逢ふ日][RK]"
