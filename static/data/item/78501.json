        "An imperial son appointed to this title by his father.  (Genji is therefore not a Prince.)  Historically, most Princes were ranked in four grades and received an imperial stipend accordingly, but some were \"unranked\" (muhon).  The tale says nothing about according this kind of status to an imperial grandson.[源氏、無品][RK]"
