        "This shrine in Kyoto was originally located in Yamato province and is the site of a series of pavilions constructed for veneration of the spirits of the Korean maternal ancestors of Japanese emperor Kanmu (r. 781-806). Regularly the object of offerings of the imperial government, the shrine was the site of the Hirano matsuri festivals of the 4th and 11th months from at least the 9th c. on."
