        "a modern term denoting horse-riding peoples\" from the northeast Asian steppe whose culture focused on pasturing and riding horses. According to Egami Namio's thesis, a group of such people invaded Japan in the second or third centuries and eventually reached Miwa, where their leaders ruled as the Yamato Miwa paramounts in the late third century. Egami's theory has been intensely debated since its introduction in the 1970s. [江上波夫、三輪]\""
