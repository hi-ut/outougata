        "The heroine of the Tale of the Bamboo Cutter (see entry), a radiant baby discovered by an old bamboo cutter in a joint of bamboo.  Her name means something like “Lady Light.”  Kaguya-hime grows up to be dazzlingly beautiful; is courted by many suitors, culminating in the Emperor himself; and at the end of the tale returns to her real home, the moon.[竹取物語、かぐや姫][RK]"
