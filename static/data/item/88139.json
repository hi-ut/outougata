        "The transience, inconstancy, impermanence of the phenomenal world; anitya. The Three Characteristic Marks (sambōin) of the Buddhist teaching are (1) that all conditioned things are impermanent (shogyō mujō); (2) that all phenomena are without persisting self or substance (shohō muga); and (3) that the goal of religious practice is tha peace of nirvāna (nehan jakujō). Buddhism proposes a solution to the problem of suffering, but its emphasis on the need to escape the inadequacies of the unenlightened state and the dangers of attachment to what is transient often give it an unwarranted reputation for pessimism.
