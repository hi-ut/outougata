        "the crown prince and heir to the tennō's throne per the ritsuryō codes. Other than details concerning the staff of the Crown Prince's residence, or Tōgū 東宮, the ritsuryō codes had little to say about royal succession. The Law on Inheritance, however, mandated that for officials of the third rank or higher, the first-born son of the senior consort was to be considered chakushi. Great King Temmu attempted to institute a stem dynasty based on primogeniture but had great difficulty doing so.↓[律令、天武]"
